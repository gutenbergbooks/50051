<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>Sometimes, as you doubtless know, the simplest
actions result in the most remarkable complications.
When Jerry Hopkins picked up a
lump of common-looking clay on some swamp
land that his mother owned he had no idea what
a strange series of events was to transpire from
his simple act. Before he realized it he and his
chums were involved in a strange secret, and they
had set off on a trip that had, as its ultimate object,
the saving of the life of Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>In this, the sixteenth volume of the “Motor
Boys Series,” I have set down what followed
when Jerry learned the value of that lump of
clay. How he and his chums started off after
the professor, who had strangely disappeared;
how they found him, almost lifeless; and how
they raced to bring the celebrated doctor to
him—all this you will find related in this book.</p>

<p>You have shown that you liked the other books
I have written concerning the “Motor Boys,”
and I venture to hope that this one will appeal
to you.</p>

<p>That there was really a two-tailed lizard was
left for Bob to demonstrate in an unexpected
manner. That is all I will say, now, regarding
that strange creature. You may turn the following
pages and learn the rest for yourselves.</p>

<p class="noic">Your sincere friend,</p>

<p>“Pretty good game; wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sure was—a corker!”</p>

<p>“I thought our Cresville boys wouldn’t be able
to pull up, after the Red Sox got that big lead on
’em, but they certainly played their heads off.”</p>

<p>“They sure did. The pitcher won the game
for them with that last wallop of his!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” remarked a stout lad, one of a
group of three who were walking slowly across
the green diamond at the conclusion of a ball
match.</p>

<p>“The umpire made some pretty rank decisions,”
added the boy who had made the first
comment, glancing across in front of his companion,
who, in the middle of the trio, separated
the two speakers.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” commented the stout youth.</p>

<p>The two exchanged looks—queer glances, and,
as if by mutual consent, gazed up at the face of
their chum who walked between them. Then
the stout lad winked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” he asked.
“Didn’t you like the game?”</p>

<p>“Game? What game? Oh, yes—sure I liked
it!” was the hurried response, as though the
speaker’s thoughts had been far afield when the
import of the question was grasped. “It was a
good little game,” went on the lad in the centre
of the trio. “Too bad our boys didn’t win,
though!”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” echoed the stout lad. “Why,
what——”</p>

<p>“Didn’t win!” interrupted the other. “Say,
Jerry, what’s got into you? The Cresville team
did win!”</p>

<p>“Oh, did they? That’s funny! I guess I
didn’t pay much attention toward the last.”</p>

<p>“No, and not toward the beginning, either, I
guess,” grumbled the stout lad. “I wonder
what’s gotten into him,” he thought.</p>

<p>“So they won; did they, Bob?” asked the lad
addressed as Jerry. “Well, I’m glad of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course they won, Jerry Hopkins,” was
the quick answer. “And this practically clinches
the local championship for them, too. It was a
corking good game; wasn’t it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking! A good crowd, too,”
and Ned Slade looked at the throng pouring
down from grandstand and bleachers.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Bob Baker, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
stout lad before referred to. “I vote not to go
home just yet. It’s early. Let’s take a little
spin down the road.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ned. “Shall we,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, yes, I’m in for whatever you fellows
say. It’ll be nice on the river to-day.”</p>

<p>“River! Who said anything about the
river?” demanded Ned. “Do you think we
came to this ball game in our motor boat, Jerry
Hopkins? Say, what’s the matter with you to-day,
anyhow? We’re talking about taking a spin
in the auto. Will you come along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure I’ll go. You know that!” exclaimed
Jerry, and with an effort he seemed to
recall his thoughts from whatever distant realms
they roamed. “Sure we’ll go for a spin. I guess
I was thinking about the ball game.”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob each gave their chum a queer
look, but they said nothing. Only Ned thought
to himself:</p>

<p>“Thinking about the ball game; eh? That
won’t go with me, when, a little while ago, he
didn’t even know which side had won. There’s
something wrong with Jerry. I wonder what
it is?”</p>

<p>But, whatever it was, it did not seem to be anything
very serious, for soon Jerry smiled at his
chums, and clapping Bob on the shoulder with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
force that made the stout youth grunt, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sure we’ll go for a spin! It will give us an
appetite for supper, and I seem to need one. I’ve
been a little off my feed the last few days.”</p>

<p>At this Bob looked worried. Eating was
something in which he took a great deal of interest.
Perhaps it was that which made him so
stout, and had gained for him the nickname of
“Chunky,” which his chums occasionally called
him.</p>

<p>The three boys—the “motor boys” they
were locally called—because they so often rode
about in motor vehicles—automobiles, motor
boats, or motor-driven airships—had come to
the ball game in their auto which stood parked,
with a number of others, back of the grandstand.
Thither they now made their way.</p>

<p>The air was filled with the noisy chug-chug of
scores of machines as they backed, turned and
darted ahead to get from the ball field to the
road. In and out of the receding throng the
autoists guided their cars. On all sides were talk
and laughter—talk of the game just finished,
congratulatory calls to the winners, and expressions
of regret for the losers.</p>

<p>“Yes, it sure was some nifty little game,” remarked
Bob, as the chums reached their machine.
“Are you going to drive, Jerry?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I will if you want me to—sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope he pays more attention to the wheel
than he did to the ball game,” remarked Ned,
with a slow shake of his head. “If he doesn’t
he’s likely to have us up a tree, or in the ditch.”</p>

<p>But he made no objection as Jerry took his
place at the wheel, and slipped in the switch key
of the electric starter. Ned and Bob got in the
tonneau, and Jerry, looking back to see that both
doors were closed, was about to start off when
a voice behind the machine cried:</p>

<p>“Hold on! Wait a minute! I won’t be a second!
Give me a lift; will you? I forgot all
about it! Terrible important message! Dad’ll
be wild if I don’t deliver it! Great game; wasn’t
it? Our boys won fine! Here I am! Let her
go! Never say die! Whizz her along, Jerry!
I’m here! Let her out, do you hear? Move the
boat!”</p>

<p>A small youth, very much excited as to manner
and words sprang, leaped, scrambled, climbed,
hopped, jumped, vaulted and fell into the vacant
seat beside Jerry. He sat there, his breath coming
in gasps, both from his run and from his
outpouring of words.</p>

<p>Jerry, with a quizzical smile, looked down at
him; Bob, with half-opened mouth, leaned forward
to gaze; and Ned shook his head in a hopeless
fashion, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Is it all over, Andy Rush?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is—is what—all over?” demanded the
small chap.</p>

<p>“Everything,” answered Ned, throwing his
hands in the air. “Your talk—your—your—well,
you know what I mean. Is it all over?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” was the quick answer. “You
can go ahead now, Jerry,” he added, as though
they had been waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Well, I like your nerve!” gasped Bob, who
at length found his voice.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I saw you had a vacant
place!” exclaimed Andy, starting off in another
“spasm.” Then he proceeded:</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get back to town in a hurry. Important
message—dad told me not to forget, but
I did—went to the ball game. Say, it was great;
wasn’t it? That fly of Watson’s—up in the air—thought
it would never come down—run around
the bases—nobody out—whoop her up! Everybody
run! Nobody out—all over!”</p>

<p>He had reared up in his seat to “explode”
this, and now sank back again.</p>

<p>Jerry looked at the diminutive orator.</p>

<p>“Are you all through, Andy?” asked the tall
lad, gently. “If you are, we’ll start, with your
kind permission and attention. Only we’re not
going back to town right away, so if you have an
important message to deliver you’d better walk,
or take a hop, skip and a jump into someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
else’s car. We’re going to take a little ride, and
we don’t know when we’ll get back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess it isn’t so important after
all,” spoke Andy, slowly. “I’ll go with you.
I’ll leave the message when I come back. You
are coming back; aren’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No telling,” answered Ned, winking at
Jerry. “We may take a notion to run over to
San Francisco and spend the night.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t care,” laughed Andy. “I’ll go
along. I can telephone the message back, I guess.
Let me go; will you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, there’s no getting ahead of you,
Andy,” conceded Jerry. “Stay in, if you like.
Only don’t blame us if your dad wants to know
why his message wasn’t delivered.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Ned. “Let her
go, Jerry. It’s hot sitting here in the sun.”</p>

<p>There was a whine and a whirr, as the electric
starter spun the flywheel of the big automobile.
Then came a snap, as the gears meshed, and as
the clutch slipped into place the machine slowly
backed to a clear place. Then, as Jerry threw in
the first forward speed, it shot ahead, and, a
little later was spinning down a pleasant, shaded
country road.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” observed Bob, leaning
back in comfort. “Want to go anywhere
special, Jerry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’ll go anywhere you fellows say.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a race!” burst out Andy Rush.
“There goes a car! You can easy pass that,
Jerry! Speed her up! Let’s race ’em! Look,
they’re laughing at us! Go ahead! Whoop!”</p>

<p>The tall steersman made no effort to increase
the speed of the car. Instead he smiled down at
the excited lad beside him, and remarked:</p>

<p>“It’s too hot to do all that talking, Andy.
Save it for the winter season when you’ll need
it. We’ll have no race to-day.”</p>

<p>If the small chap was disappointed he did not
show it. For something new claimed his attention.
A big gray squirrel scurried across the
street in front of the car.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried Andy. “Say, he can
go some! If I only had a gun now! Squirrel
pie for mine!”</p>

<p>“Squirrels are out of season now,” remarked
Bob. “You’d be fined if you shot ’em.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on to Blairtown, and have a bite to
eat,” suggested Bob, after a pause. “There’s a
good restaurant there.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Seeing that squirrel must have
made you hungry,” commented Ned with a laugh.
“But go ahead, if you like, Jerry. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Jerry, at the wheel, nodded, and for some time
guided the car in silence. Now and then Andy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made some excited remark at the sight of something
along the highway. Bob and Andy exchanged
occasional opinions.</p>

<p>“How’s she running, Jerry?” asked Bob,
after a bit.</p>

<p>“Yes, our fellows did some good running,”
was the unexpected answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, wake up!” cried Ned, with a laugh.
“We weren’t talking about the ball game.”</p>

<p>“No?” queried Jerry. “I thought Bob said
something about runs.”</p>

<p>“I was asking how the car ran,” put in the
stout lad.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jerry, comprehendingly.
“Why, she’s going like a sewing machine—just
as easy. She sure is some car!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m glad we traded in our old one, and
got this,” commented Ned. “That self-starter
alone is worth the difference. No more breaking
our backs cranking up.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not reply to this. After his remark
to Bob he had relapsed into silence again—a
silence to which Ned called his chum’s attention
by a nudge.</p>

<p>“Something sure has gotten into Jerry,” whispered
the stout youth.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chunky,” agreed his companion.</p>

<p>They rode on for some distance farther, Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
guiding the car skillfully enough, even though his
mind did not seem to be on his task.</p>

<p>As he turned up a cross road, that would take
them to Blairtown Ned, glancing up suddenly,
cried out:</p>

<p>“Look out, Jerry! Where are you steering?
You’re heading right for that other car!”</p>

<p>A big machine, coming from the opposite direction,
and at high speed, was headed directly
for the auto of the motor boys. But it was on
the proper side of the highway, whereas Jerry
was on the left.</p>

<p>“Look out!” Bob cried, springing to his feet.
“We’re going to have a smash, sure!” He
leaned forward to open the side door, as though
he would leap out.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>JERRY EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Sit still!” yelled Ned, grasping his chum by
the arm.</p>

<p>“But we’re going to smash, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Bob sank back in his seat with a thud, for Ned
had forcibly pulled him by the coat.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Andy, adding his alarm
to the others.</p>

<p>“Eh? What is it? Oh, another car!” cried
Jerry, and, for the first time, he seemed to be
aware that there was danger from his thoughtlessness
in taking the wrong side of the road.</p>

<p>The driver of the other car sent out a strident
blast from his electric siren, and crowded his machine
as far over to the other side as possible.
But a high bank afforded very little leeway.</p>

<p>“Look out where you’re going!” the chauffeur
yelled, his angry voice accentuating the
warning of the horn.</p>

<p>Jerry Hopkins seemed to come to life in an
instant. His absent-mindedness left him in a
flash, and his strong hands turned the steering
wheel rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>So suddenly did he shift the direction of his
car that it skidded, and, for an instant slid along
on two tires. Then, with another quick shift of
the wheel, the steersman brought it back on the
proper course.</p>

<p>The two machines passed safely, but, so narrow
was the space between them, the thickness
of one’s hand would have sufficed to fill it.</p>

<p>Then, in a swirl of dust, the other machine
passed on, the dirt-cloud serving to hide the indignant
glances of the occupants. Jerry brought
his car to a stop with a whine of the hastily-applied
brakes.</p>

<p>“Say, I didn’t see that fellow coming,” declared
Jerry, turning to speak to his chums in the
tonneau.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see him!” cried Ned. “Why,
he was right in front of you, and on the proper
side of the road, too. You were off. Say, what’s
the matter with you Jerry, anyhow?”</p>

<p>The tall lad did not answer for a moment.
Instead, he slowly got down out of the car, and
walked over to a spring that bubbled out of a
rock at the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Wait until I get a drink,” he said. “I’m
dry.”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob looked at one another.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Ned, in a
low voice, as Jerry leaned over to drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” was the answer of
the stout lad. “He’s been acting queer and
absent-minded for the last few days. He seems
to be worrying about something.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what it can be?” ventured Ned.</p>

<p>“Let’s ask him,” suggested Bob. “Maybe we
can help him.”</p>

<p>They spoke in louder tones now, for Andy,
who had been sitting beside Jerry, had also
alighted to get a drink at the spring.</p>

<p>“Maybe he wouldn’t want us ‘butting-in,’”
remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, something’s got to be done,” declared
Bob, with a sigh. “I’m not going to ride, and
have him steer like that. He nearly ran over a
dog a while back, and now he almost sends us
into another car. Something sure is wrong.
Jerry has something on his mind, and we ought
to offer to help him.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we ought,” responded Ned,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>And while the two chums are thus debating as
to whether or not they ought to interfere sufficiently
in Jerry’s affairs to offer to help him, I
will take a few moments to tell my new readers
something of the boys and of the previous books
in this series in which my heroes have figured.</p>

<p>Bob Baker, son of Andrew Baker, a rich
banker; Ned Slade, whose father, Aaron Slade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was the proprietor of a large department store;
and Jerry Hopkins, the only son of a well-to-do
widow, were the three “motor boys” with whom
we are concerned. They lived in the town of
Cresville, not far from Boston, and had been
chums and companions ever since they were
youngsters. They had been “lost” together,
they had played ball on the vacant lots, they had
gone swimming and fishing in one another’s company,
and, when they grew older, they went bicycling
together.</p>

<p>It was the bicycles that gained for them the
name “motor boys,” for it was through the winning
of a bicycle race that one of them gained a
motorcycle as a prize, and in the first book of
the series, entitled “The Motor Boys,” you may
read of this thrilling contest.</p>

<p>But the motor boys were not content with one
motorcycle, nor with winning one race. They
obtained an automobile, and made a thrilling
trip overland, afterward going to Mexico, where
they located a buried city, coming home across
the great plains.</p>

<p>Many and thrilling were the adventures our
friends had on land, and not a few dangers encompassed
them, some being due to the evil doings
of Noddy Nixon and Bill Berry, two bad
characters.</p>

<p>But action ashore was not sufficient for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
motor boys. They were able to obtain a motor
boat, and in the fifth volume of this series, entitled
“The Motor Boys Afloat,” is related their
adventures in that staunch craft. They had strenuous
times on the Atlantic, in the strange waters
of the Florida Everglades, and on the Pacific.</p>

<p>As might be expected, having, in a manner,
conquered the problems of the land in their automobile,
and of the water in their motor boat, the
boys sighed, like Alexander, for new worlds.
They found one in the air, and though they
themselves were a little doubtful of their ability
to navigate an aeroplane they did not hesitate to
try.</p>

<p>In the ninth book, “The Motor Boys in the
Clouds,” I had the pleasure of relating to you
their adventures in their motorship. They flew
over the Rockies, and over a part of the ocean,
and again, taking wing, they went in search of a
lost fortune.</p>

<p>Hovering over the border between the United
States and Canada, the motor boys were able to
help Uncle Sam capture some daring smugglers,
and hardly had they finished that thrilling work
than new activities presented themselves. The
volume immediately preceding this one is entitled
“The Motor Boys Under the Sea.”</p>

<p>While out in their motorship <i>Comet</i>, one day,
the boys saw floating on the waters of Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Bay a strange object which at first they
thought was a whale. It turned out to be a submarine,
however, and when the boys encountered
it, later, in a terrific storm, and were taken aboard
the strange craft, being kept virtually prisoners,
they realized that they were about to pass
through some strange scenes.</p>

<p>Whether they did or not I will leave to the
decision of those of you who have read the book.
Suffice it to say that, eventually, Dr. Klauss, the
commander of the submarine, though endeavoring
in his insane fury to make an end of them
all, was overpowered, and our friends reached
safety.</p>

<p>A winter of comparative inactivity followed
the lively times in the submarine, and now spring
had come once more. The motor boys had made
no plans for their vacation, but they had talked,
more or less indefinitely, of a long trip to be
taken, partly by auto, and partly aboard their
new motor boat. Nothing had been settled, however.</p>

<p>The three, having no other engagement this
Saturday afternoon, had gone to the ball game,
for Cresville boasted of a good semi-professional
team, and it was on their way back from this
contest that I have introduced my new readers
to them.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make the break, and ask Jerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
what ails him,” decided Ned, as he watched his
tall chum straighten up after taking a long drink
at the spring.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe it will be best,” assented Bob.
“He surely isn’t himself. He’s been acting
queerly for nearly a week. He seems to be in a
sort of dream.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “Well, maybe
he won’t like me ‘butting-in’ on him, but we’ve
been chums too long to stand off, and not help
him when he needs it.”</p>

<p>Andy Rush, who had begged a ride with the
three friends, had just run down the road in
pursuit of a rabbit, so he was not within sound
of the voices of the three chums. Andy was an
excitable chap, who never did any one thing very
long at a time. He was rather a “fly-away,” but
Ned, Bob and Jerry liked him for all that.</p>

<p>“Feel better?” asked Ned, as his tall chum
approached.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was fine water. But there wasn’t
anything the matter with me,” replied Jerry,
quickly, as he sensed Ned’s words. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“What do I mean? Well, Jerry, old man,”
spoke Ned, “it’s evident to both Bob and me
that something is wrong with you. It isn’t like
you to have such a near-collision as the one we
just avoided, and also to nearly run over a dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as you did a while back, isn’t a bit like you.
Neither is it to see you so absent-minded.</p>

<p>“Now we don’t want to pry into your affairs,
Jerry,” went on Ned, with a look at Bob, “but
if we can help you—why, you know we’re only
too willing. Is there anything we can do?”</p>

<p>“For we’re sure something’s wrong,” put in
Bob. “Suppose we go to that restaurant in
Blairtown and eat. I can always talk better when
I eat,” added Bob, innocently enough.</p>

<p>“The same old Chunky,” murmured Jerry,
with a smile. Then his manner grew more serious.</p>

<p>“Understand!” exclaimed Ned, quickly, as he
noted the change in his chum’s face, “we don’t
want to ‘butt-in,’ but we would like to help you.
Are you in trouble, Jerry? Noddy Nixon isn’t
bothering you again; is he? And Dr. Klauss
hasn’t turned up again with his submarine; has
he?”</p>

<p>“No! Oh, no! It isn’t anything as serious
as that,” and Jerry smiled.</p>

<p>“Well?” spoke Ned, questioningly.</p>

<p>Jerry hesitated for a moment, and looked up
and down the road, as though to make sure no
one could hear what he was going to say.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” began the tall lad, “I sure do
appreciate your interest in my affairs. And I
don’t consider it ‘butting-in,’ either. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
I have been acting queerly, the last few days,
but——”</p>

<p>“Queerly! I should say you had!” cried
Ned. “It’s all right, old man,” he added, with
a laugh, “no offense you know, but if you call it
‘queer’ to nearly smash us up a couple of times,
I guess we’ll agree with you. Now then, out
with it, and if we can help you, why, you know
you don’t have to ask twice. Let her go, as Andy
Rush would say,” and he glanced toward that
distant youth.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that it’s so very important,
or serious,” resumed Jerry. “But, the truth of
the matter is, I’ve been doing a lot of hard thinking
of late, and I suppose it’s that which has
made me seem absent-minded.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any ‘seeming’ about it,” put
in Bob. “It was the real article.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it was,” admitted Jerry. “I
really couldn’t tell you, now, who won that ball
game, and as for nearly running into that auto,
I didn’t see it until the last second. I was thinking
of something else.”</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, business matters,” explained Jerry.
“You know my mother owns considerable property.
Some of it is real estate, and more is in
bonds and mortgages. Of late some of her investments
have turned out poorly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” exclaimed Ned. “She
ought to see my father. He might help her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t think it is as serious as all
that,” said Jerry. “But she thinks she will have
to sell some of her real estate, and there’s where
the tangle comes in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what sort of a tangle it can be,”
spoke Ned. “We all know her land is quite valuable.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” exclaimed Jerry. “If she
had received an offer for some of her town lots,
or for some of her other real estate holdings that
plainly show their worth, I wouldn’t think so
much of it. But it’s about that old strip of swamp
land she owns.”</p>

<p>“What, down in Ryson’s swamp?” asked
Ned, in surprise.</p>

<p>“That’s the place,” answered Jerry. “She
owns quite a strip there, and Noddy Nixon’s
father owns lands on one side, and someone else
on the other. Mother’s land is a sort of narrow
tongue between two other parcels. She never
thought it was worth anything, but the other day
she received an offer for it, and at a price that
made her open her eyes, though relatively it
wasn’t so much.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see any bad luck in that,” remarked
Bob. “If she can get a good price for
the land, why doesn’t she take it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just the point,” resumed Jerry. “Why
should such a comparatively high price be offered
for such seemingly worthless land? It’s that
which has me guessing, fellows. I’m trying to
find out what the underlying motive is, and that’s
what made me so absent-minded of late. Now,
I’ve told you!”</p>

</div>


<p>There was silence among the three chums for
several moments, and then Ned remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, you sure have been absent-minded,
Jerry, though maybe it was justified. But it
doesn’t seem to be so very serious—except, of
course, we’re sorry your mother has lost any
money.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “And now, if
that’s all that’s on your mind, Jerry, let’s go
and——”</p>

<p>“Eat!” broke in Jerry, with a smile. “I can
easily guess that was what you were going to
say, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no offense,” put in Jerry, hastily. “I
feel so much better, from having told you fellows,
that I think I can eat a bit myself.”</p>

<p>“Who made the offer to your mother?” asked
Ned. “That is, if it isn’t a secret,” he added,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Jerry. “The offer came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from the Universal Plaster Company of New
York.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I don’t wonder she’s suspicious
of anything that comes from New York!” broke
in Bob. “There are more swindlers in that town
than anywhere else in the world.”</p>

<p>“That’s because it’s such a big town,” observed
Ned, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t either,” insisted the stout lad.
“I got stung there once myself. I saw an advertisement
of how to double your money, and,
as I was short, I sent on the dollar bill they
asked.”</p>

<p>“Did you learn how to double your money?”
asked Ned, chuckling.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the fat youth, shortly. “They
sent back word to fold it lengthways, and it would
be doubled all right. Talk about a bunch of
swindlers! Tell your mother to be on her guard,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I will, Bob. And I’m looking out myself.”
Jerry was laughing now.</p>

<p>“The Universal Plaster Company,” murmured
Ned. “And so that concern wants to buy the
swamp land of your mother’s, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ned.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a concern is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Their letter head doesn’t
show. But it’s the price they offered that made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
me suspicious. It’s a lot more than the land is
worth.”</p>

<p>“And that makes you think——” began Ned.</p>

<p>“That there’s something we don’t know
about,” finished Jerry. “Either there is some
valuable deposit on that land, or else the strip
my mother owns is wanted for some development
project. In either case the swamp piece may be
worth a lot more than this Universal Plaster
Company is offering, and, if it is, she ought to
get the benefit of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “But you ought
to be able to find out, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I ought to—yes. But so far I haven’t been
able to. I can’t find out anything about this
plaster company, except that it is a New York
concern. I don’t know whether they make plaster
for houses, or porous plasters for sick people.
It’s a new concern, and they aren’t giving away
their secret. But they’ve made mother a good
offer for the land, and she wants to take it.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t want her to?” suggested Ned,
questioningly.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” Jerry agreed. “I want to
look into it more, and find out what’s at the bottom
of the offer. If the land is worth as much
as they are willing to give, it may be worth more.
But mother doesn’t agree with me. She wants to
sell right away, particularly as the letter said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
offer would be withdrawn in a few days, if not
accepted.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s chums were silent a moment, and then
Ned spoke.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with us fellows going
over to Ryson’s swamp, and taking a look at the
land your mother owns, Jerry?” he asked.
“There’s been a lot of rain, lately, and we can
almost get up to it in the motor boat, by going up
Cabbage Creek. We can wear boots and wade
when we can’t go any farther in the boat. Maybe
we can get a line of how things are going that
way. If there’s coal, or diamonds, on that land
we might be able to see it.”</p>

<p>Jerry laughed.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe there’s anything as valuable
as that on the swamp piece,” he said. “But, all
the same, I’m suspicious. It’s very good of you
boys to take an interest in my affairs.”</p>

<p>“Huh! It’s nothing of the sort!” cried Bob.
“You’d do the same for us. I’m in favor of
Ned’s plan—to go take a look at the place.”</p>

<p>“All right, then we’ll go,” assented Jerry.
“We’ll start the first thing Monday morning.
The offer doesn’t expire until the end of next
week, and by that time we may find out something.
It would be a queer thing if that swamp
tract should prove valuable.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Here comes Andy!” exclaimed Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as the small chap was seen returning from his
unsuccessful chase after the rabbit. “If he once
gets wind of anything like a secret it’ll be all
over town in a day or so.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “We’d best
keep still about it.”</p>

<p>“Say, I hope I didn’t keep you fellows waiting!”
exclaimed Andy, running up. “Thought
sure I’d get that rabbit—he couldn’t run very
fast—I was right after him—hop, skip and jump—up
hill and down—through the bushes—I almost
had hold of his hind leg once—I fell down—in
the mud,” he needlessly added, for it could be
seen plainly on his clothes. “Up again—on
again—rabbit went in a hollow log,” resumed
Andy, in his most excited voice. “I tried to build
a fire and smoke him out, but I couldn’t. We’d
have had rabbit potpie if I’d got him.”</p>

<p>“Rabbit potpie nothing!” cried Bob. “Rabbits
are out of season, too. Come on, hop in and
we’ll go to that restaurant. I’m half starved.”</p>

<p>“Chunky’s usual state,” commented Ned, as
he took his place beside his stout chum.</p>

<p>Jerry resumed his position at the wheel, with
Andy on the seat beside him, and once more the
auto started off. This time the tall lad paid more
attention to the steering, and there were no near-accidents.</p>

<p>But, if Jerry was not as absent-minded as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had been, still his thoughts were busy over the
offer for the swamp land. And he realized why
his mother was so anxious to have the money
that might be paid for it. Though Mrs. Hopkins
was quite well off, she depended on the income
from her investments, and if some of these failed,
she would need to have a larger capital in order
to get the same return from the interest.</p>

<p>“But I’m going to try to induce her not to sell
that land until I find out why those fellows are so
anxious to get it,” mused Jerry, as he drove on
in the big touring car.</p>

<p>It was dusk when the motor boys and Andy
Rush returned to Cresville, after having had
supper at the restaurant. Bob’s appetite proved
even better than he himself had suspected, and
the other boys were not far behind him. Andy
Rush, too, in spite of his inability to sit still very
long at a time, ate his share.</p>

<p>“And now, fellows, we’ll see if we can solve
the mystery of the swamp land!” exclaimed Ned
Slade on the Monday morning following, when,
with Jerry and Bob, he had taken his place in
the staunch motor boat.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll make a try for it, anyhow,”
agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Has your mother heard anything more from
that plaster concern?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a letter from them this morning,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
replied the tall lad, “reminding her that
this week, Saturday, was the last day they would
hold their offer open.”</p>

<p>“Did they say what they’d do if she didn’t
accept it,” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, but they intimate that she would regret
it,” answered Jerry. “So we’ve got a week before
us, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The motor boat chugged off. Cabbage Creek,
whither the boys were bound, was a sluggish
stream, flowing from the swamp into a river
which ran near Cresville.</p>

<p>The creek was navigable, part of the way up,
for fairly large boats. Then the channel shallowed
until only canoes could be used. But now
a rainy spell had poured more water than usual
into the creek, and the motor boat could be taken
up it almost to the land owned by Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“And we can put on boots and walk when we
can’t go any farther in the boat,” spoke Jerry,
looking at three pairs of hip-boots in a seat locker.</p>

<p>Talking of various subjects, but, in the main,
of the matter at present in hand, the boys sailed
up Cabbage Creek. The sluggish stream was
deeper than they had anticipated, and they did
not have to stop, and tie the boat, until they were
within a few hundred feet of Mrs. Hopkins’s
land.</p>

<p>The swamp was surely a dismal place. Tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gaunt trees, most of them dead, reared their
branchless trunks high above the black water.
Rotted and decayed stumps, in all sorts of grotesque
shapes, lay half submerged in muddy pools.
Trailing vines were all about, and hummocks of
wire grass, here and there, offered uncertain footing.</p>

<p>“The only thing valuable I see about this
place,” remarked Ned, “would be a place to take
moving pictures of something like ‘Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.’ It looks enough like the Everglades to
be part of Florida.”</p>

<p>“It sure does,” agreed Bob, as he threw a
piece of canvas over the seat locker containing
the lunch he had been thoughtful enough to bring
along. “That’ll keep off the sun,” he said, in
explanation to his chums, who looked questioningly
at him.</p>

<p>“Yes, it sure is dismal,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“And that’s all the more reason why I think
it’s strange they offered so much for the land,”
observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is this your mother’s land here?” asked
Bob, motioning toward a tract just beyond the
boat.</p>

<p>“No, it’s farther in. If you fellows want to
go to it, better put on the boots.”</p>

<p>“Of course we want to go,” assented Ned.</p>

<p>A little later they were stepping from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
grass hummock to another, carefully making
their way through the swamp.</p>

<p>“Mother’s land begins here,” said Jerry, indicating
the remains of a wire fence, the posts of
which had rotted away. “Now if any of you
can tell me what’s valuable about this——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Ned, stopping his chum.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“There are some men over there—just beyond
those trees and bushes,” went on Ned. “They
seem to be digging.”</p>

<p>He pointed, and Jerry, following the line of
Ned’s index finger, saw some men with long-handled
spades, removing what seemed to be yellow
clay from a tract of land just beyond the
boundary of his mother’s land.</p>

<p>“They’re after clay!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” admitted Jerry. “I always
knew there was clay here, though. There’s nothing
new in that. But it’s no good. A man once
tried to use it to make pottery, but it wasn’t the
right kind. He said it wasn’t worth taking out.
If that’s what those fellows are after they’re going
to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>Jerry spoke louder than he intended, and his
voice must have carried to the clay-diggers. One
of them looked up, and, seeing the three boys
cried out:</p>

<p>“Hey, you fellows! Clear out!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>SUSPICIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins looked at the men sharply.
With the exception of one, who seemed to be a
sort of foreman, they were all laborers. Just
who had spoken neither Jerry nor his chums
could determine exactly, for there were five men
looking at them, four resting on their long-handled
spades.</p>

<p>“Huh! He’s got nerve, whoever he is,” remarked
Jerry. “I think I see myself chasing off
my mother’s land!”</p>

<p>“Are we on her property now?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but she has a right of way over
this strip, leading in from the creek. We’ll be
on her land as soon as we cross that low fence.
Come on, fellows! We’ll see what this means!”</p>

<p>Jerry started forward, his chums following.</p>

<p>They tried to step from one grass hummock
to another, but at times they would slip off,
and into the mud and water. It was well they
had thought to wear long rubber boots.</p>

<p>The three boys had not more than crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fence, to stand with uncertain footing on the land
owned by Mrs. Hopkins, than the man who
seemed to be the foreman hurried forward.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” he
demanded, angrily. “Can’t you understand plain
United States?”</p>

<p>“Why, I guess so, when it’s properly and politely
spoken,” drawled Jerry, with provoking
calmness.</p>

<p>“Come, now! None of your impertinence!”
blustered the man.</p>

<p>“And none of yours!” cried Jerry, sharply
this time.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said!” snapped the man.
“I told you to clear out! This is private property,
and trespassers aren’t wanted. We’ll have
signs up in a day or so, but, in the meanwhile,
you’ll have to take my word for it. Get off this
land!”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re laboring under a slight delusion,”
went on Jerry, speaking evenly. “You
may have some authority over that land on the
other side of the fence, but, as it happens, my
friends and I are on my mother’s property, and
we don’t propose to vacate for you, trespass signs
to the contrary.”</p>

<p>The man seemed to start. He gazed keenly
at Jerry for a second, and then looked along the
line of fence. In many places the boundary mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had fallen over, because the posts holding the
wire had rotted away. In other sections there
was no fence at all, but there were enough posts,
and sufficient wire, to indicate where the fence
had originally run.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you, young man,” said the foreman,
speaking slowly, “but you speak as though
you knew what you were talking about,” and his
tone was more respectful than at first.</p>

<p>“I do know,” was Jerry’s brief answer.</p>

<p>“And you say you’re on your mother’s land
there?”</p>

<p>“We are.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be——”</p>

<p>“Jerry Hopkins,” supplied the tall lad, with a
twinkle in his brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. We did hear that Mrs. Hopkins
owned a strip of land somewhere about here, but
we didn’t know just where it was. And, as my
company happens to have bought up most of this
swamp, we didn’t care to have the public walking
about it. It’s dangerous—for the public,” he
added, with what he evidently meant for a frank
smile. But, somehow, in spite of that smile,
Jerry and the boys took an instinctive dislike to
the man. He did not seem sincere.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a bit dangerous in here,” agreed
Jerry, looking across to where the men had been
digging. Piled about them were heaps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stiff, yellow clay, which underlay the top layer of
slime and mud. “I don’t get here very often
myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you are here, let me introduce
myself,” went on the man. “I am Rickford Fussel.
Sorry I can’t give you a card, but I don’t
carry them when I’m out prospecting.”</p>

<p>At that word Bob gave Ned a nudge, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Did you hear that? Prospecting! He’s
after gold, sure!”</p>

<p>“Dry up!” ordered Ned, in a like whisper.
“You leave this to Jerry. Whoever heard of
gold in a swamp like this?”</p>

<p>“Then it’s diamonds!” hissed Bob.</p>

<p>Ned tried to wither his chum with a look, but
Bob evidently had big ideas in his head. He
looked triumphantly at his companion.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know you,” said Jerry to the
man. That was polite fiction on his part, but it
is a common expression, so we will let it go at
that. “I’m Jerry Hopkins, as I told you,” he
went on, “and these are my friends, Bob Baker
and Ned Slade.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you all,” responded Mr. Fussel.
“I’d shake hands only I’m pretty dirty,”
he went on, showing his palms, covered with the
yellow clay. “Sorry I tried to order you off
your own land,” and he laughed, but it was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
forced. “Mistakes will happen,” he continued.
“And so this is the Hopkins strip? I guess you
know our company has tried to purchase it from
your mother,” and he looked at Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes. She said something about it,” Jerry
replied.</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything to do with that part of it,”
went on Mr. Fussel. “I’m only connected with
the field forces—the prospecting line.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re from the Universal Plaster
Company?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the concern.”</p>

<p>“And you say you are—prospecting,” resumed
Jerry, hesitating over the word. “Is it
for anything special? What line is your company
in?”</p>

<p>“There you’ve got me,” admitted Mr. Fussel,
with seeming frankness. “I’ve only been with
them a short time, and, as far as this present job
is concerned, I was only told to make some ditches
to drain this land.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you’re not getting out the clay?”
asked Ned, taking a part in the talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Fussel glanced at Ned sharply.</p>

<p>“We’re taking out clay, certainly,” he said,
and again he seemed to want to appear very frank
and open. “But we have to do that to make the
drainage ditches deep enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jerry, and there was considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
meaning in his tones. “Some folks
have tried to make use of the clay, but they
haven’t succeeded,” went on the tall lad.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to amount to much, that’s a
fact,” spoke Mr. Fussel, kicking a lump of the
yellow stuff into a nearby puddle of water.
“Well, I’m glad to have met you boys, and I
want to tell you how sorry I am that I ordered
you off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” responded Jerry,
quickly. “We just came out to have a look at
the place. I sort of wondered what your company
wanted my mother’s land for.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t tell you,” declared Mr. Fussel.
“As I said, I have only been with the concern a
short time. All I know about the Universal Plaster
Company is that it is incorporated to do all
sorts of business. It can buy and sell land, erect
buildings, manufacture anything it sees fit to, that
isn’t protected by patents, and, in short, deal in
all sorts of things. It’s one of those corporations
with a very liberal charter.</p>

<p>“Just at present it is engaged in developing
this land. This swamp can easily be drained, and
the land made much more valuable. But it will
take considerable money to do it. That is why
it has to be done on a large scale.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose the swamp would be valuable
if it could be made dry,” admitted Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“It certainly can!” declared Mr. Fussel, with
conviction. “I’m an engineer by profession, and
I am sure of that. But what the company will do
with the land when it is drained is more than I
can say.”</p>

<p>“Does the concern own much swamp?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“As far as you can see,” replied the engineer.
“That is, all but your mother’s strip, and I understand
negotiations are under way to obtain that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are,” admitted Jerry, for Mr. Fussel
looked at him questioningly. “But I’m not so
sure my mother will sell,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Well, of course you and she know your own
business best,” remarked the engineer, “but if
the land were mine, and I had a fair offer for it
from a concern that owned on all sides, I should
sell. Her land will be of no value after the
property all about it is drained,” he resumed,
“and if the water is allowed to remain on her
land it will not only make it valueless, but will
be a nuisance to the adjoining property.</p>

<p>“In fact,” and Mr. Fussel again smiled frankly,
“I am not certain but what your mother could
be compelled to drain her land to prevent the
water from it from running on our land, after
we have made it dry,” he said. “My company
would probably go to law about it, and, while we
do not desire litigation, we could not afford to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
have our land spoiled, after going to a big expense
draining it, you see.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed impulsive Bob,
hardly knowing what he was saying.</p>

<p>Ned gave his fat chum a dig in the ribs that
made Bob grunt.</p>

<p>“Hey! What’s the matter with you?” he
asked of Ned, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. I was killing a mosquito that
was biting you,” replied Ned, winking at Bob;
whereat Chunky subsided.</p>

<p>“Well, my mother hasn’t quite made up her
mind,” said Jerry, slowly, for the engineer seemed
to expect him to say something. “I just thought
I’d take a run out here. I wanted to see why
the Universal Plaster Company wanted the land.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you, plainly, I don’t know,” said
Mr. Fussel. “It may want it for building purposes,
or the erection of some sort of a plant, or
it may be trying to demonstrate a new method of
drainage. All I know is that I was told to drain
this swamp, and I’m doing it. You’ll see a big
change here in a few weeks. You fellows can
keep on working,” he said, addressing the laborers.
“We’re only sinking experimental ditches
now,” he resumed, “to ascertain the direction of
the flow of the surface water.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of that yellow clay,” remarked
Ned, half casually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; isn’t there?” exclaimed Mr. Fussel.
“It’s hard digging in it, too. Mr. Nixon was
glad enough to part with his swamp land,” he
continued, “and so was Colonel Wright. Now,
when we get your mother’s strip, we’ll have the
whole tract,” and he smiled at Jerry. He seemed
to like to smile, perhaps to show his big white
teeth.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps she’ll sell,” spoke our tall
hero. “I’ll tell her what I’ve seen, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fussel went back to direct his men. Jerry
and his chums walked about a little, but there
was nothing more to see. It was gloomy and
dismal in the swamp, and the mosquitoes were a
pest. The boys’ hands and faces were badly
bitten.</p>

<p>“The next time I come here I’m going to bring
along a bottle of citronella, and a bundle of Chinese
punk sticks!” exclaimed Bob, slapping vigorously
at his neck.</p>

<p>“That’s right! They’re fierce!” agreed Jerry.
“Well, I guess we might as well go back.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the motor boat, seemingly
indifferent to the operations of the men in the
swamp. But, when he was out of their sight,
around a clump of trees, Jerry began digging
with a sharp stick, turning up some of the yellow
clay.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Ned. “Going to plaster some of that on your
mosquito bites? I’ve heard that mud was good
for a bee sting, so it might be good for mosquito
bites.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” said Jerry. “I just want
to get some samples of this clay, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you said it was no good,”
spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“I did say so,” admitted Jerry, “but I’m not
so sure of that now. Ned, did you happen to
notice that, though Fussel said they were only
making drainage ditches, the men had all the yellow
clay they took out piled in one place? Did
you notice that?”</p>

<p>“I did, but what does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means, in my opinion,” said Jerry, slowly,
“that those fellows were up to some other game
than merely draining this swamp.”</p>

<p>“You think——” began Ned, excitedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly what to think,” interrupted
Jerry, “but I have my suspicions. I’m
going to have this clay analyzed. It may be of
some value after all, and mother’s land is full
of it! In fact, there’s more on her strip than anywhere
else in the swamp.”</p>

<p>For a moment Jerry’s chums looked at him
curiously, and then Ned exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s right! There may be something
back of all this. Come on, Bob, help get some
of this mud.”</p>

<p>“Say, it’s nasty and sticky,” complained the
stout youth, who was somewhat fastidious about
his personal appearance.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind!” laughed Jerry, who did
not mind soiling his hands. “I only want a little
for analysis. I’ve got enough,” and he wrapped
a chunk in some green leaves that he pulled from
a wild grapevine.</p>

<p>“And you really think it might be of some
value?” asked Ned, washing his hands in a pool
of water, for he had dug up a small chunk of the
yellow clay for Jerry.</p>

<p>“As I said, I’m not a bit sure—only suspicious,”
spoke the tall lad. “It’s worth taking a
chance on, that’s all. And certainly, if what Fussel
says is true, and he’s draining the swamp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mother’s land won’t be of any use unless that’s
drained also. And, in case there’s no value in
this clay, she might as well get rid of her property
to this concern, that has offered a good price—that
is, if there’s nothing back of it.”</p>

<p>“Then if you can’t find anything valuable in
this clay you’ll advise her to sell?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think so. And from the fact that several
persons have tried to find some use for this yellow
mud, and have failed, I’m not very hopeful,”
went on Jerry. “But it would be a fine thing if
mother could make some money out of this swamp
land. For she has lost considerable of late.”</p>

<p>“Has she?” asked Bob, sympathetically. “I
thought you said a few days ago that it wasn’t
much.”</p>

<p>“It’s turned out worse since then,” and Jerry’s
usually smiling face wore a worried look. “In
fact, fellows, my mother may be very glad to sell
this swamp land,” he went on.</p>

<p>“No wonder he was absent-minded,” confided
Bob to Ned in a whisper, as they got in the motor
boat, while Jerry was busy loosing the bow line.</p>

<p>“Yes—I had no idea the trouble was so serious,”
admitted Ned. “Well, we’ll help him if we
can.”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” agreed the stout youth, heartily.</p>

<p>On the way down Cabbage Creek the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
talked of the clay-diggers, speculating as to what
could be their object. But they could arrive at
no definite conclusion.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you’re of any use after all?”
exclaimed Jerry, kicking the lump of yellow clay
at his feet.</p>

<p>“It might be good to caulk a boat,” suggested
Ned, “and I see we’ve got a little leak here,” he
added, as he pointed to some water in the pit
below the flywheel of the motor.</p>

<p>“That comes in through the stuffing-box,” said
Jerry. “It just needs a little tightening. We’ll
haul her out to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we ought to get her in good trim, and
take a long trip,” suggested Bob. “We could
pack up a lot of grub——”</p>

<p>“There he goes! Grab him before he makes
it any worse!” laughed Ned, extending a hand
to clap over Bob’s mouth. But the fat lad evaded
his tormentor.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” Bob protested. “We’ll
want something to eat if we go on a cruise; won’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Sure we will!” agreed Jerry. “Don’t let
him worry you, Bob. He’s just as fond of eating
as you are, Chunky, only he hides his bad habit.
But, seriously, fellows, what are we going to do
this vacation?”</p>

<p>“We ought to do something,” declared Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“Every summer we have gone somewhere, or
done something. I wouldn’t mind finding another
buried Mexican city.”</p>

<p>“Me either!” cried Bob. “Or locating the
hermit of Lost Lake.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t a bad stunt,” admitted Jerry.
“I don’t know as I care for a trip like our last
one, though, in a submarine. It’s a little too uncertain,
especially when you’re cooped up under the
sea with a madman.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said it!” cried Bob. “I think our
airship stunts were about as good as any. The
time we went after that fortune we had lots of
exciting times.”</p>

<p>“And when we were over the ocean, looking
for the lost dirigible—that kept us guessing,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“Quit it, fellows,” begged Jerry. “You’re
getting me all excited. I want to start off on a
trip right now!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we?” asked Bob, quickly.</p>

<p>Jerry, for answer, kicked the lump of clay at
his feet.</p>

<p>“I first want to get this business settled,” said
the tall lad. “After that I may go off somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget us,” urged Ned. “We want to
be in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll all go together,” Jerry agreed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
“It won’t take long to settle the question about
this clay, I think. And then we can go off on a
trip. What’ll we take—the airship, motor boat
or automobile?”</p>

<p>“All three!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s a little too much of a proposition,”
laughed Jerry. “We might cut out the airship,
and take turns using the car and this boat. We
could send the car on ahead, and after a long
cruise pick up the auto at some place, journey as
far as we liked in that, and come back to the
boat.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good!” cried Ned. “Let’s do
it!”</p>

<p>None of the chums realized under what
strange circumstances they were soon to take a
trip of that sort.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll think about it,” agreed Jerry, as
he guided the boat on her homeward course.</p>

<p>With this new thought to occupy their minds
the boys found plenty to talk about, varying their
remarks occasionally with references to the clay-diggers.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” began Ned, diffidently, “if you’re
short of cash, you know—I mean if your mother’s
investments—oh, hang it! Say, if you want a
loan, you know where to come for it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Say, count me in on that!” added Bob, with
energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got my mining stock,” went on Ned,
“and you know if it hadn’t been for you we
wouldn’t have that! So call on me for all you
want, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“And me, too!” interjected Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s awfully good of you fellows,” spoke
Jerry, his voice a bit husky. “But it isn’t as bad
as that. I have my stock, too, when it comes to
that. But I don’t imagine we’ll go to the poor
house this year. I appreciate your offers just the
same.”</p>

<p>The boys were in receipt of comfortable sums
of money from a gold mine they had helped an
old miner to recover, as told in a previous volume.</p>

<p>Winding in and out, along the devious channel
of Cabbage Creek, the motor boat finally reached
the broader river that led to the dock near Jerry’s
house. As the craft approached the little pier the
boys saw a small crowd assembled on it.</p>

<p>“Hello! Something’s up!” exclaimed Jerry,
who was guiding the swift craft.</p>

<p>“Hope nobody has fallen overboard,” observed
Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>A moment later they heard a shrill voice crying:</p>

<p>“He’s got it! There it is! Hold his legs,
somebody! Don’t let him fall in! Oh, he’s got
it! A big one, too!”</p>

<p>“That’s Andy Rush!” cried Bob. “It sure
is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and somebody is evidently in the water,”
chimed in Ned. “Hurry up!”</p>

<p>“No, he spoke of an ‘it,’” declared Jerry.
“And there isn’t quite enough excitement to indicate
a drowning.”</p>

<p>“Well, speed up and see what it is,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“Hurray! He’s got it!” cried Andy Rush,
and the excitable chap could be seen dancing about
the outer edge of the crowd on the dock.</p>

<p>Jerry guided the boat to the stringpiece. The
crowd moved back, and parted. A small man,
who had been stretched out full length, with his
head and shoulders over the edge of the wharf,
suddenly arose. He had a small net in his hands,
and something in the meshes was wiggling.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried the little man. His hat
fell off, revealing a shiny bald head and a pair
of spectacled eyes. “I have it!” he cried again.
“The finest specimen of a calico bass I have ever
seen! Now my collection is complete!”</p>

<p>He held the dripping net and the wiggling fish
afloat, and then his eyes fell on the boys.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry said nothing. He shut off the motor,
and, as he looked at the lump of yellow clay in
the bottom of the boat, he thought:</p>

<p>“This is most opportune! I’ll get Professor
Snodgrass to analyze this for me.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The boat was made fast and the boys climbed
out on the dock, the throng of sight-seers making
way for them. Professor Snodgrass, the well-known
scientist, was holding aloft his net, containing
the flopping fish.</p>

<p>Andy Rush, not satisfied with the view he had
had of the professor’s prize, crowded forward to
get a closer look. And then something happened.</p>

<p>Whether Andy’s head collided with the net,
knocking it from the hand of the professor, or
whether the latter had an insecure grip on the
handle, or whether the fish itself caused the accident,
probably will never be known. At any rate,
the net slipped, turned over, and, a moment later
the fish was flopping about on the dock, doing
its best to get back into the water.</p>

<p>“There it goes!”</p>

<p>“Stop it!”</p>

<p>“Grab it, somebody!”</p>

<p>“Fall on it!”</p>

<p>“Get a hook and line!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>These were the cries from the crowd of men
and boys on the dock. As for Andy, he stood
rubbing his head where it had come in contact
with the iron ring of the net. The professor at
first looked dazed, then alarmed, and then anxious.
He gazed at his empty net, and next at the
flopping fish, which he had called a calico bass.
It seemed to be something between a sunfish and
a perch.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that fish get away!” he cried, finding
his voice at length. “It’s worth a lot of
money to me! Don’t let it get away.”</p>

<p>Some of the crowd were laughing, and others
took the words of the little scientist earnestly.
Among them were the three motor boys, who
well knew the value their friend attached to his
living specimens.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it!” cried Jerry, toward whom the
fish was flopping its way.</p>

<p>“No, I can nab it!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Let me try for it!” suggested stout Bob.</p>

<p>It was like several out-field ball players each
trying to catch a high fly.</p>

<p>Andy Rush, realizing that it was probably as
much his fault as anyone’s that the fish had gotten
out of the net, also made a dash forward.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it! I knocked it out! I’ll grab it!
Put your foot on it! Rub your hands in sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and then it won’t slip out! Hit it with a club!
Grab it! I’ll get it!” spluttered Andy.</p>

<p>“No! No! Don’t hurt it! Don’t hit it, or
kill it! If you use violent measures the fish will
be spoiled as a specimen!” cried Professor Snodgrass.
“I had rather let it get in the water, and
net it again, than to harm it.” He danced about
excitedly.</p>

<p>But no one seemed to pay any attention to him.
Nor did the little scientist notice our three friends.
His attention was all on the escaping specimen.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Andy, suddenly throwing
himself forward, full length on the dock. The
fish was just ahead of him, and it seemed that the
small chap must capture it.</p>

<p>But Andy had given himself too much impetus.
He threw himself not only down on the dock, but
over the edge of the stringpiece as well, and, an
instant later, clothes and all, he disappeared beneath
the surface of the river. The fish, too, had
vanished.</p>

<p>Then, if possible, the excitement increased, only
Andy was not present to add his shouts to the din.
He was under water and could not yell.</p>

<p>“Man overboard!”</p>

<p>“Throw him a line!”</p>

<p>“Get your boat ready, fellows!”</p>

<p>Thus cried those in the crowd as they peered
anxiously over the edge of the dock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was really little danger. Andy was
a good swimmer, the water near the dock, while
rather deep, had no current, and the boy had on
light summer clothes. In a moment he rose,
gasping, to the surface.</p>

<p>“Let me take your net, Professor!” exclaimed
Jerry to the little scientist.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Professor Snodgrass really
realized who Jerry was, well enough as he knew
the lad and his chums. But the scientist’s mind
was on the fish.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried someone.</p>

<p>“Who, my specimen?” asked Mr. Snodgrass,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, Andy Rush!” was the answer, and indeed
it was the small chap who had bobbed into
view.</p>

<p>“Here you go, Andy!” cried Jerry, extending
the net handle. “Grab hold of this my
boy!”</p>

<p>Andy, with a shake of his head, cleared his
eyes of water, and reached out one hand for the
pole.</p>

<p>“Use your other paw!” cried Jerry. “I’ll
haul you out then.”</p>

<p>“Can’t—can’t use my—my other—hand!”
panted Andy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—is it hurt?” Jerry
wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurt? No, but I’ve got the professor’s fish
in it!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Ha! My fish! Good boy!” cried Professor
Snodgrass. “Hold on to it, and you shall be
rewarded.”</p>

<p>“All—right!” gurgled Andy, for just then
some water splashed in his mouth.</p>

<p>The swimming lad held up one hand, to show,
tightly clasped in the fingers, the fish. Then, with
the other hand, or “paw,” as Jerry had called it,
Andy grasped the pole of the net. He was pulled
up far enough so that he could hand the fish to
the scientist.</p>

<p>“That’s the boy!” cried the professor, as he
opened a box, into which Andy dropped the wiggling
creature. Then the lid was slammed down.</p>

<p>“Now I have you, my little beauty!” the professor
exclaimed, dancing about in boyish delight.</p>

<p>Andy, with both hands free, now secured a
good grip on the pole, and Jerry soon hauled him,
dripping wet, to the dock. The excitement calmed
down, and, for the first time, Professor Snodgrass
seemed to note the presence of our three friends.</p>

<p>A word at this moment about the professor.
Readers of the previous books of this series know
him well. Dr. Snodgrass was a learned scientist,
belonging to several prominent societies. His
chief business in life was the collecting of rare
specimens of animal life, from snakes to snails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and from monkeys to lizards. He was connected
with a large Boston museum, and his activities
were directed to securing specimens for it. He
traveled all over, going here, there, everywhere
in search of queer specimens, of which he either
heard, or which his studies convinced him lived in
certain localities.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had made the acquaintance
of the boys some years before, and had gone
with them on many of their expeditions, to collect
rare bugs or animals. That was all he did. He
took little or no interest in the object of the expedition,
as far as the boys were concerned. All
he cared about was his specimens. It might be a
blue-nosed monkey, a triple-toed frog or some
such queer thing that he sought, but, whatever it
was, the professor usually got it, sometimes most
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Well, is it all over?” asked Ned, as he
watched Andy take off his coat, and wring some
of the water out of it. “Have you got your
specimen safe, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, thanks to this brave young man.
I must reward him, as I promised.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right!” exclaimed Andy. “It
was my fault, I guess, that the fish got away.
And I didn’t mind the bath. It’s a hot day.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, bless my soul! It’s Andy Rush!”
cried Professor Snodgrass, seeming to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Andy for the first time. The little chap had often
gone with the boys and the scientist on trips.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m Andy,” admitted the owner of that
name.</p>

<p>“And here’s Jerry, Ned and Bob,” proceeded
the scientist. “Why, bless my soul! I quite forgot
all about you. I was so interested in getting
that fish. I must see if it is safe,” and he looked
in a box he carried slung over his shoulder by a
strap—a box half-filled with grass.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s there all right,” the scientist announced
with glee. “Now I must painlessly put
it out of misery, and see to its preservation.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here, and where did you
come from?” asked Jerry, as soon as most of the
crowd dispersed, seeing no more chance for excitement.</p>

<p>“Why, I am on one of my usual collecting
trips,” replied the professor. “So far I have not
been successful, and, as I found myself in the
vicinity of Cresville I thought I would stop off
and see you.”</p>

<p>“Glad you did,” interjected Ned, for the scientist
was always welcome.</p>

<p>“I stopped up at your house, Jerry, as is my
custom,” the little bald-headed professor went on,
“and your mother made me very welcome. She
said you boys had gone off in your motor boat,
but would soon be back—especially as it was near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
dinner time,” and the professor looked at Bob,
but he did not smile.</p>

<p>“Um!” mumbled the stout lad.</p>

<p>“So, knowing you would land at this dock, I
came down here,” went on Mr. Snodgrass.
“While waiting, it occurred to me that I might
profitably occupy my time by using a net, to see
if I could get any rare fish specimens.</p>

<p>“I was fortunate enough to secure a beautiful
calico bass,” the scientist went on. “That is a
fish something like a perch, but partaking also of
the nature of a sunfish. I got one in my net, in
spite of the distractions of the crowd that gathered
to watch me, and—well, I guess you know
the rest,” he finished with a smile. “I thought
surely my fine specimen was gone, but I have you
safe, my beauty!” he exclaimed, again looking in
the box.</p>

<p>“And,” resumed the professor, “now that
everything is all right, I will go back to your
house, Jerry, and make some notes concerning my
latest success.”</p>

<p>“Was that what you started out after—a calico
bass!” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, my dear boy, that is only a side issue,
as you boys would say,” was the answer. “What
I am really after is a two-tailed lizard. I am not
certain that such a creature exists, but, from having
examined many specimens of lizards, and finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
some with rudimentary evidences of once having
possessed two tails, I am convinced that such
creatures once did exist.</p>

<p>“I made a statement to that effect before one
of the learned societies to which I belong, but my
statement was questioned by a rival, Professor
Battin. He laughed at the idea of a two-tailed
lizard. I said I would prove to him that such a
creature existed, and I am going to do it!</p>

<p>“I at once set out from Boston, and, knowing
that you boys always go off on summer trips, I
came to you. May I accompany you on your
travels this time? I am sure I shall find the two-tailed
lizard somewhere, and I always have good
luck when I go with you boys. May I accompany
you on this occasion?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Professor,” said Jerry, heartily.
“But we have made no plans as yet.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? You surprise me!” the professor
exclaimed. “Usually, at this time, you
are ready to go away.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s two chums looked at him, as though he
might explain.</p>

<p>“The truth of the matter is,” began the tall
lad, “there is a little trouble afoot. If we can
settle that, one way or the other, we may go on
a trip. And perhaps you can help us!” he exclaimed,
as he went back to the boat, bringing up
the lump of yellow clay. “I’d like to know, Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Snodgrass,” said Jerry, earnestly, “whether
or not that clay is good for anything; and if so,
for what?”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass looked at it, smelled of
it, touched a bit to his tongue, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry, I shall have to analyze it to tell
what it is good for; if anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I didn’t expect an answer off-hand,”
said the tall youth. Then he asked Mr. Snodgrass
about his activities since their last meeting,
and, thus talking, the boys followed the little scientist
to Jerry’s home. Andy went on to his own
house to don dry garments.</p>

<p>“A two-tailed lizard!” grunted Bob to Ned,
as they walked in the rear. “That’s about the
craziest stunt yet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know what the professor is,”
said Ned, tolerantly.</p>

<p>For nearly a week, while he remained the guest
of Mrs. Hopkins, Professor Snodgrass tested and
analyzed the yellow clay. Then, one afternoon,
coming out of the room he had fitted up as a
laboratory, his hands and face covered with the
yellow mud, Professor Snodgrass remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry, I’ve finished!”</p>

<p>“You mean you have analyzed the clay?”
asked the youth, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have given it the last test, as far as
I am able.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what do you find?”</p>

<p>“Is it valuable?” demanded Ned, who, with
Bob, was at his chum’s home.</p>

<p>“Does it contain gold or diamonds?” Bob
wanted to know, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” and the professor smiled.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the sort of clay that contains
aluminum,” suggested Jerry, a bit apprehensive
at the look on the face of the professor.</p>

<p>“No, Jerry, nor aluminum either.”</p>

<p>“Is it good for anything?” asked the tall lad,
desperately.</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry, as nearly as I can tell, and I
have subjected it to numberless tests, that yellow
clay would make excellent material for filling in
waste land, but that’s all,” was the disappointing
answer of the scientist.</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t any good?” faltered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world, my dear boy,” was
the final report. “I am sorry, but it seems to me
to be absolutely valueless!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A QUEER CONFERENCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That Jerry Hopkins, especially, and his two
chums, relatively, were disappointed by the verdict
of Professor Snodgrass may easily be imagined—and
“disappointment” is putting it mildly.
True, there had been no real grounds for thinking
that the queer, yellow mud was of any value,
and yet Jerry had chosen to assume as much. And
his half-belief had affected his chums. Now to
find out that it was worthless was something of a
shock.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t imagine any use for it,” went on
Dr. Snodgrass, as he fingered the sticky, yellow
lump Jerry had handed to him. “I am familiar
with most kinds of clay in this region, and this
is not among the valuable sorts. What made you
think it was, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, the way those fellows seemed to be
taking it out for one thing, and the eagerness with
which they are trying to get mother’s land for
another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure they were taking out the clay
itself?” asked the scientist.</p>

<p>“They said they were merely excavating
ditches to drain the swamp,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I think that is more likely to be right
than that they are trying to utilize the clay itself,”
went on the professor. “I am sorry, boys, but—Oh,
there’s one of those queer green flies I’ve been
trying so long to capture. One moment, Mrs.
Hopkins. He is on your dress! Please don’t
move, and I’ll have him!” and with that, dismissing
from his mind, for the moment, all
thoughts of the clay the professor “concentrated”
on the fly in question.</p>

<p>He stole softly up to the side of Jerry’s mother,
and, with a little net, which was never absent from
him, Mr. Snodgrass made a neat capture of the
buzzing insect.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are, my beauty!” he exclaimed,
as he clapped the fly into a small wire box. It
was anything but a beauty, being very large, with
a green body, and unpleasantly mottled wings—a
vicious-appearing fly. But to the professor it was
beautiful from a scientific standpoint.</p>

<p>“A rare insect!” he murmured, holding the
wire box up to the light to examine his catch more
closely. “A rare find. This has been a lucky day
for me.”</p>

<p>“And an unlucky one for us,” remarked Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
disconsolately, as he tossed the lump of clay out
of the window.</p>

<p>“Maybe someone else could give you another
opinion about it, Jerry,” suggested Bob, as the
three chums went out. They knew it was of little
use to question the professor further. He had
given his ultimatum, and, besides, he would be
so interested now in his new specimen—preserving
it and making notes about it—that he would
find time for nothing else.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going to bother any more about
it,” declared Jerry. “The professor evidently
knows what he’s talking about. I guess I was on
a wrong lead. Those fellows must have been
telling the truth, though it didn’t seem so. I was
foolish to dream that the clay could be valuable.
I guess mother will have to sell the swamp land
as a bog tract and nothing else. Come on, let’s
go for a spin in the car.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll do him good,” whispered Bob to
Ned, while their tall chum was filling the gasoline
tank from a supply in the garage. “He sure has
got the blues.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “We don’t
often see Jerry that way, either. His mother
must have lost considerable money, and he depended
on the swamp land to make up the shortage.
Well, it’s too bad!”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>If Jerry had been absent-minded on the occasion
of the ride following the ball game, he was
much more so on this occasion. He was so careless
in his steering that once he nearly ran into a
tree, and another time he came so close to running
down an elderly man that Bob and Ned, in
the rear seat of the automobile, leaped up in
alarm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” cried Ned, when
the machine was slowed down.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed the tall lad. “I
guess one of you fellows had better take my place.
I get to thinking about that yellow clay, and I
can’t put my mind on anything else. You’d better
steer, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I had, old man, if we count
on getting home safely.”</p>

<p>“But say, you aren’t still thinking that clay is
any good; are you?” asked Bob. “Not after
what Professor Snodgrass told you?”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s foolish, but I am,” admitted
Jerry, as the auto proceeded after the change of
seats. “Somehow I can’t help thinking that
there’s more in it than appears on the surface.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it!” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going out there to have another
look in a day or so,” decided Jerry. “Maybe
those fellows will show a bit more of their hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and I can get a line on what their game is. Yes,
I’m going to have another look.”</p>

<p>“Will you have time before your mother
makes up her mind to sell?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. There’s a new slant to the affair
now. It seems those fellows have bought up all
the swamp but the tract mother owns. And, if
she doesn’t sell, they threaten to shut off her right
of way—that is, even if she owns the land she
won’t be able to get to it unless she goes up in
our airship.”</p>

<p>“Can they do that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It seems they can. No one ever thought
much of that swamp land, and deeds and papers
regarding it weren’t as carefully drawn as they
would have been if the land had been on the
main street. So if mother doesn’t sell, her land
won’t be worth anything, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” sympathized Bob. “Still,
it may be for the best after all.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>In the days that followed the professor’s characterization
of the yellow mud as worthless, the
boys saw little of him. He was off, presumably
searching for the two-tailed lizard, a reptile in
which our heroes, for the time being, took little
interest.</p>

<p>“The professor sure has found some queer
things in his day,” admitted Ned, “but this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
limit! I wonder if he really believes there is such
a thing?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course such a thing is possible, as a
freak,” spoke Jerry. “I saw a two-headed calf
at a fair, once, so a two-tailed lizard wouldn’t be
so much out of the way.”</p>

<p>The professor seemed willing to search indefinitely
around Cresville for the lizard, or other
specimens, though, once or twice, he did ask the
boys when they expected to start off on a tour,
for no summer went by without seeing them off
after some sort of adventures.</p>

<p>“We’ll go next week,” decided Jerry. “By
that time this land business will be settled, one
way or the other, and I’ll feel easier in my mind.
Now let’s go out there, and see what’s up.”</p>

<p>They went up Cabbage Creek to Ryson’s
swamp in the motor boat, as on a former occasion,
making their way to the land owned by Mrs.
Hopkins, wading with their big rubber boots.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, here you are again!” called Fussel,
with what he probably meant to be cordiality.
“Better make the most of your trips here,” and
he laughed.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Jerry, though he
guessed at the other’s meaning. Jerry looked
around. Considerably more work had been done
in excavating, and it did look as though only
drainage was the object, for long ditches had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dug, the yellow clay being piled about promiscuously.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to close up that right of
way, if we don’t get that tract there,” and Fussel
motioned to Mrs. Hopkins’s land on which the
boys were standing. “Have to use an airship on
your next visit, I guess,” and he smiled, showing
his big, white teeth.</p>

<p>“That’s what we thought,” spoke Jerry, with
a laugh. He was not going to let the foreman
gain an advantage on him by being good-natured.
Jerry could play that game, too, if it meant anything.</p>

<p>The boys looked about them. There seemed
to be more men digging in the swamp than on
their former visit. The laborers were delving in
the mud and water with their long-handled
shovels, taking out the sticky mud and clay. The
yellow stuff lay beneath a layer of black peat, and
Jerry noticed that the peat was piled on one side
of the ditches, while the yellow clay was stacked
on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>They made their way to where the motor boat
was moored, and, as they reached it, Jerry looked
back for a moment in the direction where the men
were digging in the swamp. As he did so he
uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s up? Another bite?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No! But look!” whispered Jerry. “Isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that Professor Snodgrass?” and he pointed toward
the place of the yellow mud.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed Ned. “He must be looking
around here for the two-tailed lizard.”</p>

<p>They saw the little scientist, with his green
specimen box and his butterfly net, talking to Fussel.</p>

<p>“Seems like they have met before,” observed
Bob, and indeed the boys noted a cordial greeting
between the professor and the foreman of the
diggers.</p>

<p>“Oh, the professor would make friends with
anybody who could tell him where to find a new
kind of pink-nosed mosquito,” laughed Jerry.
“Shall we wait for him?”</p>

<p>“Better not,” recommended Ned. “Dr. Snodgrass
will want to stay here all day, gathering
specimens, and if he has a liking for being eaten
up by swamp mosquitoes, I haven’t. He wouldn’t
want to come with us, anyhow, very likely. Let’s
leave him to his own devices.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry, but, as the tall lad
set the motor going he looked back at the place
whence they had come. He was somewhat surprised
to see Professor Snodgrass and Foreman
Fussel in apparently earnest conversation. And
the subject seemed to be the yellow clay, for the
foreman was holding a lump of it out to the scientist.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>SELLING THE LAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Though Jerry thought it rather strange that
the professor and the foreman should be in such
close conference, and, though he wondered very
much what it could be about, his cogitations did
not “get anywhere.”</p>

<p>That is, he could formulate no theory that
made matters plain to him. He had an idea, once
or twice, of speaking of the matter to his chums,
but he did not know exactly how to go about it.</p>

<p>Then, too, both Bob and Ned seemed so sure
that the professor had come to the swamp, as he
went to other queer places, merely to collect bugs,
that it would be hard to make them believe otherwise.
Not that Jerry himself was sure of anything
else, but he was somewhat given to fancies,
and he had some queer ideas in his head just then.</p>

<p>He said nothing, however, and the motor boat
chugged her way out of the tortuous channel into
the creek, thence to the river, and so to her dock.</p>

<p>“Well, I sure am glad to get out of that place,”
observed Ned, looking at several large and rapidly-swelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
mosquito bites on his hands. “If
we’d stayed there much longer they’d have eaten
us alive.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of eating——” began Bob, with a
hopeful expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have some pie!” mocked Ned.
“Go to it, old man! I’m with you. That swamp
air seemed to give me an appetite.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry. “But if you fellows
want to eat, why not go down the river a
ways, and have some good grub at Fletcher’s?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” exclaimed Ned. “Then we
won’t have to go home to dinner.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” cried Bob. He generally
was when the “eats” were concerned.</p>

<p>The boat, which had approached the dock, was
turned out into the river again by Jerry. Then
over the water floated a plaintive voice, calling:</p>

<p>“I say, fellows! Hold on! Come back! It’s
fearful hot! I want a ride—come and get me—I’ll
stand treat—ice cream—lollypops—lemonade—come
on back and take me!”</p>

<p>“It’s Andy Rush!” observed Jerry, not looking
around. He knew the voice well enough.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s hopping up and down on the
dock,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Let him hop,” went on Jerry. “He’ll give
us all the fidgets on a hot day like this. Let him
hop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>And let him hop they did, much to the disgust
of small Andy Rush, who ran back and forth,
begging and pleading to be taken for a ride in
the motor boat. But our friends had other plans.</p>

<p>They very much enjoyed their dinner at the
river-house pavilion, but, through it all, Jerry
could not forget the sight of the professor and
the foreman talking about the clay.</p>

<p>“But I guess the plaster company—whatever
sort of a concern it is—thinks it can make use of
the mud as a sort of by-product,” mused Jerry.
“Probably there’s so much of it they don’t want
to cart it away unless they can find a use for it.
Well, I wish, for mother’s sake, it had some
value; but if it hasn’t—it hasn’t—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better begin to think of where
we’re going for our vacation,” remarked Ned, a
little later, shoving back his chair, for the meal
was finished.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “I hope if we
go anywhere we have as——”</p>

<p>“Good grub as this—isn’t that what you were
going to say, Chunky?” finished Jerry, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, what if it is?” asked the stout lad.
“I guess you fellows are as fond of eating as I
am, when it comes to that.”</p>

<p>“Sure we are, Bob,” spoke Ned. “Now let’s
talk of where we can go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better wait and see where the
professor thinks is the most likely place to find
the two-tailed lizard,” suggested Jerry. “It
doesn’t make much difference to us where we go,
and it does to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Ned. “We’ll have
a talk with him.”</p>

<p>But it was some time before the boys had a
chance to carry out their plans, and talk with the
professor, for, from the moment they had seen
him in consultation with the foreman in the
swamp, there set in such a chain of old happenings
as the boys had never known. And these
took the professor out of communication for a
considerable period.</p>

<p>“I can’t see what keeps Dr. Snodgrass,” said
Mrs. Hopkins to Jerry, some hours after her son,
and the other boys, had returned from the river.
“He never stayed out as late as this before.”</p>

<p>“Not unless he was after specimens that fly
after dark,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>The scientist had not been home all that afternoon.
Jerry told of having seen him in the swamp,
though they did not stop to speak to him. Now
it was after supper, and dark, and he had not returned
to the Hopkins home, where he was a guest.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’d better get the boys and go
out after him?” mused Jerry. “That swamp
is a bad place to be lost in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t like to think of you going out
there at night, Jerry,” objected his mother.
“Though of course, if anything were to happen
to the professor, it would be——”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now!” interrupted Jerry,
with a note of relief in his voice. Steps were
heard on the front steps, but they did not prove
to be those of the little scientist. Instead they
were those of a messenger with a note.</p>

<p>“It’s from the professor!” exclaimed Mrs.
Hopkins, as she read it.</p>

<p>“What does he say?” asked Jerry, quickly.</p>

<p>“Why, he isn’t coming home to-night,” answered
the widow, some surprise manifest in her
voice. “He is on the track of some insect—he
gives the Latin name of it, but I can’t pronounce
it. He’s too far away from Cresville to get back
until late, and he doesn’t want to put us out. He
will stay at a hotel all night, and come here to-morrow
or next day.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s considerate, at all events,”
yawned Jerry. “Now that I don’t have to
worry over him I think I’ll go to bed.”</p>

<p>It was not unusual for the scientist to remain
away several nights when he was on the trail of
some rare specimen, and Mrs. Hopkins and her
son were not alarmed, now that they had received
word from him.</p>

<p>“Where did he send that from?” asked Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wondering how long the professor had remained
in the swamp.</p>

<p>“It’s from the hotel at Bellport,” replied his
mother. “He telegraphed here from there.”</p>

<p>“He must have had a ride in someone’s auto
then,” commented the tall lad, “for he never
could have walked to Bellport from the swamp.
That’s what happened—he got a ride on the
road.”</p>

<p>“All his things are here,” said the widow.</p>

<p>“He’s got his net and a specimen box,” commented
Jerry. “They’re all the baggage he
needs.”</p>

<p>The professor did not come back the next day,
or the next. Instead came another note saying
he might remain away a week, for he had not
yet obtained the specimen he was after.</p>

<p>There was nothing strange in this, for he had
done the same thing before.</p>

<p>“But if he wants to go with us on a trip he’d
better come back pretty soon,” said Bob, one day
when he and Ned were calling on Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be back soon now,” declared the
tall lad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the matter of Mrs. Hopkins’s land
came to an issue. The Universal Plaster Company
served formal notice on her that if she did
not agree to their terms they would drop all negotiations,
and her land would be of little value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
since there would be no right of way to reach it.
Then, too, their lawyer pointed out, Mrs. Hopkins
did not have the best title in the world. It
was threatened that her claim could not be substantiated
in the highest court, and suit was
threatened if she did not agree to sell without
litigation.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re practically forcing you to sell
that land, Mother!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“I know it, my boy,” answered the widow.
“But what can I do? I really need the money
from it, though it isn’t so much. I need it at
this time especially, for some of my securities
are so depreciated that it would be folly to sell
them. Later on they may increase in value.
Meanwhile the money from the land will tide
us over.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, I have some money from the
mine.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Jerry!” she exclaimed, with a gentle
smile. “I am not so poor as all that. You keep
your little fortune. I dare say my affairs will
come out all right after all. I shall sell the
swamp land, even though the company is practically,
as you say, forcing me to do by threats.”</p>

<p>“If only that yellow clay was of some value,”
observed Jerry. “But the professor said it was
not.” So the swamp land was sold, and Professor
Snodgrass did not appear.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>A HURRIED DEPARTURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Three men were seated about a table in a
small room. On the table were several instruments,
a delicate scale, glass vessels and test
tubes, a burning alcohol lamp that flickered under
a pan, in which boiled, bubbled and steamed some
odd-smelling mixture.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it almost done?” asked one of the men.
“It seems to me, Professor Bailey, that it has
cooked long enough.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Professor Snodgrass?”
was the reply of the one appealed to.</p>

<p>“Hum! Well, you might put a little more of
the clay in, and add a bit more glycerine. I think
that would make it about the right consistency,”
and the little bald-headed man bent over the
steaming pan.</p>

<p>“All right, here goes a little more of the clay,”
and the third member of the trio, who in the dim
light could be identified as Rickford Fussel, put
in the pan some of the yellow mud that he and
his men had dug from the swamp. “There’s
plenty of it—that’s one consolation,” he laughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“and if it proves to be what we want, why,
there’s a fortune in it.”</p>

<p>“Several of them, I should say,” was the opinion
of the man who had been called Professor
Bailey. He looked at Professor Snodgrass for
confirmation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted the little scientist, nodding
his head thoughtfully. “There is no reason why
this mixture should not replace the old-fashioned
poultice and mustard plaster. It seems to be
highly efficacious. But I want to make that final
test on a large swelling, as I told you, before I
give my deciding opinion.”</p>

<p>“And you want to be sure the mixture is just
right before you try it; is that it?” asked Fussel.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Professor Snodgrass. “You
say you have the subject on whom it can be
tried?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got the subject. He’s one of our
workmen, and his knee is badly swelled from
rheumatism. If this yellow clay, with the medicines
we have put in it, will cure that, it will do
other things in the medical line that will make
it worth all the money we paid for the land, and
more too.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” responded Professor Snodgrass,
gravely.</p>

<p>Again he bent over the pan that was simmering
above the alcohol flame. He put in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
more of the yellow clay, that was in a box on
the table, and added some glycerine and other
things, stirring the mixture slowly. A pleasant,
aromatic odor filled the room.</p>

<p>“I think we might now call in the man on
whom we are to try the experiment,” said Dr.
Snodgrass, after taking some of the mixture, and
examining it.</p>

<p>Fussel went to the door and called:</p>

<p>“Here you are, Bill!”</p>

<p>A man limped and shuffled into the room.</p>

<p>“How’s the pain?” asked Professor Bailey,
a man with curiously shifting eyes. He never,
except by chance, looked you squarely in the face.</p>

<p>“The pain is fierce!” exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>“And the swelling?” asked Fussel.</p>

<p>“Worse! My knee is as big as your head!”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” and Fussel rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bill, indignantly. “Huh!”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean it’s good for our experiment,
and it’ll be good for you when the pain is gone
and the swelling reduced. Now put out your leg
and we’ll clap the plaster on.”</p>

<p>The man, whose trouser leg was slit to the
knee, exhibited a red, inflamed and swollen leg.
He could hardly move it.</p>

<p>“Now look here!” blustered Bill, “no monkey
business, you know! I’m willing to stand for
this experiment, ’cause you paid me, and ’cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
none of the other doctors seem to do any good.
But no hocus-pocus! No cutting, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing like that,” agreed Fussel, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better explain,” Professor
Snodgrass said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” agreed Professor Bailey.</p>

<p>“My friends here,” began Dr. Snodgrass (and
how Jerry would have stared had he heard the
scientist address Fussel as a “friend”), “my
friends,” Professor Snodgrass went on, “have
accidentally discovered a valuable medicinal
clay.”</p>

<p>“We discovered it,” broke in Fussel, “but it
wasn’t until we appealed to you that you suggested
a use for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, be that as it may,” went on the professor.
“They have found a deposit of a curious
clay that, when there is mixed with it certain
kinds of medicine, acts as a most efficient poultice,
or plaster.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you know what you’re talkin’ about,
but I don’t,” grumbled Bill. “All I know is that
my legs hurts.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Professor Snodgrass. “Well,
I will make it more simple. Did your wife ever
put a mustard plaster on you for pain?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she has, and it burned like fire, too!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I expect so. And did you ever have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on a flaxseed poultice?” resumed Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Once, when I had pneumonia.”</p>

<p>“Well, this new plaster, made of medicated
clay, takes the place of a mustard plaster, or a
poultice. It will draw out pain, soreness and
swelling, as we have proved in several cases.
We now wish to try it on a larger scale, and
with a severe case. It will not hurt you, and it
may benefit you greatly. Are you willing to risk
it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk most anything to get rid of this
pain!” cried Bill. “It’s fierce! Go ahead with
your plaster.”</p>

<p>The mixture in the pan was stirred some more.
Then a part of it was spread on a cloth, and,
when it was cool enough, it was put on the inflamed
knee.</p>

<p>“Ouch! It burns!” cried Bill, jumping up.</p>

<p>“It will soon cool,” said Professor Snodgrass.
“Sit still!”</p>

<p>The knee was bound up, and Bill limped away.</p>

<p>“We’ll look at it in the morning,” said Fussel.
“Then you’ll be much better.”</p>

<p>“If I’m any worse I’ll be dead,” grunted Bill.</p>

<p>“It is most fortunate that we met you, Professor
Snodgrass,” spoke Professor Bailey, when
the things had been cleared from the table. “We
thought there was some value in the clay of the
swamp, but it needed your specific line of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to bring it out. We are deeply indebted to
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so much as you imagine,” was the
professor’s answer. “My accidental visit to the
swamp resulted in the finding of several valuable
entomological specimens. And I have not yet
despaired of finding the two-tailed lizard here. I
must resume my search to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The professor, who was stopping at the hotel
in Bellport, sought his room, leaving the two
men, in the house they had engaged not far from
the hostelry, gazing thoughtfully at each other.</p>

<p>“He put us on the right track,” said Fussel.</p>

<p>“He sure did,” agreed his companion. “And
as soon as we have the widow’s land we won’t
need to keep under cover any longer. Once we
have the deed we can announce our discovery,
and I guess the stock of the Universal Plaster
Company won’t soar! Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“It will be a big thing,” agreed the other.
“Medicated clay—no more flaxseed poultices or
mustard plasters. The new method will receive
the indorsement of all physicians. There’ll be a
fortune in it for all of us.”</p>

<p>“And the best of it is that no one around here
suspects what we are up to,” went on Fussel.
“We’ve fooled ’em all!”</p>

<p>“And we mustn’t let this Snodgrass give us
away,” cautioned Bailey. “We must get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
him, now that he has shown us how to use the
clay.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I hope it works on Bill.”</p>

<p>And it did. The new plaster mixture did all
that was expected of it. The swelling was all
gone from Bill’s inflamed knee next morning, and
the pain much less.</p>

<p>“I thought it would work!” cried Professor
Snodgrass, as he came over from his hotel to look
at the patient. He went into a long explanation
of the process of the plaster—how it contracted
the small capillaries, and brought the internal
poisons to the surface, where the clay absorbed
them.</p>

<p>“I don’t care how it did it, as long as my
swelling is gone down, and I can go to work!”
cried Bill.</p>

<p>The new plaster was a success. They had
proved it before on small cases, and now, on this
severe one, their opinions had been confirmed.</p>

<p>“And there’s clay enough in that swamp to
make us all rich!” cried Fussel to Professor
Bailey, when they were alone.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must get the Hopkins tract,” was
the answer. “The best and the most of the clay
is on that. We must have her land—by hook
or crook.”</p>

<p>And so, while Professor Snodgrass was busy
looking for the two-tailed lizard, and other rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
specimens, and, incidentally, giving advice to his
new “friends” about the yellow medical clay,
negotiations for obtaining the land of Mrs. Hopkins
were under way. They were nearly concluded,
when, one night, Professor Snodgrass, who
was calling on Professor Bailey and Fussel, remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe I am going to find that
lizard here. I will leave the hotel and go back
to my friend, Jerry Hopkins. He and his chums
must be about ready to start on a trip. I am
always lucky when I go with them. I shall surely
find my two-tailed lizard!”</p>

<p>Fussel and Professor Bailey stared at each
other. Then they looked at Professor Snodgrass.
The same thought was in the minds of
both.</p>

<p>“Are—are you a friend of Jerry Hopkins?”
asked Fussel.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I’ve known him for some years.
He and his chums have often taken me with them
on their trips. I’ve been with them ever since
we discovered a buried city in Mexico. Oh, what
rare specimens I got there! Those were happy
days. But now I need that two-tailed lizard, and
they may be going to the very place where I can
find it.”</p>

<p>“And where is that?” asked Fussel, winking
at his companion over the professor’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t say, as to that. But no matter
where the boys go I am sure to have some luck.”</p>

<p>“And you want a two-tailed lizard?” mused
Fussel, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do!”</p>

<p>There was a rapid interchange of looks between
the two conspirators.</p>

<p>“Say!” suddenly exclaimed Fussel, “why
didn’t I think of it before? You know that shack
of mine—that hunting cabin up in the Maine
mountains, Professor Bailey?”</p>

<p>“Of course I know it, Rick. What about it?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you remember those queer-looking,
crawling things that used to bother us so.
Weren’t they lizards?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, now I come to think of it; they
were!”</p>

<p>“And didn’t they have a sort of double tail;
not two tails side by side, but one on top of
the other—the short one on top; didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“By Jove! So they did!” cried Professor
Bailey, clapping his hand on his leg as though the
idea had just occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re just what the professor is
looking for,” went on Fussel. “I didn’t dream
of it before, but those were a sort of two-tailed
lizard.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, with a hopeful look on
his face, gazed from one to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gentlemen, is this so?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, of course I don’t know what sort of a
two-tailed lizard you are after,” observed Fussel,
slowly, “but the kind you want might be up
around a place I have in the mountains. If you
like, I’ll let you stay there and hunt for the things.
Glad to do it, in fact.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” cried the professor, with enthusiasm.
“Where is it? How do I get there? Tell
me about it!”</p>

<p>They did, in a jumbled, confused way which
showed how quickly they had made up the story
between them. But the professor was not critical.
All he thought of were the lizards.</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” he decided. “I’ll leave for Cresville
at once, and get the things I left with Mrs.
Hopkins. Then I go. The boys can join me
later if they wish. I’ll go to Cresville at once!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t need to do that!” exclaimed
Fussel, again winking at the other professor.
“You can get a train from here. In fact, one
leaves this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“But I have many things, and some rare specimens,
at the Hopkins house.”</p>

<p>“No matter. We’ll send there and get them
for you, and forward them to you. Just write a
note, or order, saying you want them. We’ll attend
to the rest.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Professor Snodgrass. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was in a sort of daze. All that stood out clearly
in his mind was the chance of getting the two-tailed
lizards.</p>

<p>While he was writing the note to Mrs. Hopkins,
requesting her to deliver to the bearer his
possessions, Fussel and Bailey went out of the
room.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Bailey. “A close call,
that!”</p>

<p>“I should say so! I never knew he was a
friend of the Hopkins chap, or I’d never have
asked him to make an examination of this clay.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve done it now. It’s too late to
be sorry.”</p>

<p>“But no damage is done, if he doesn’t tell how
valuable it is until we get possession of the land.
After that we don’t care what happens.”</p>

<p>“No; but we must get him out of the way
before he has a chance to talk. We’ve got to
ship him right off. He mustn’t even see the Hopkins
lad, or his chums.”</p>

<p>“You’re right; he mustn’t. We’ll have to keep
him on the move. Fortunately he’s so wrapped
up in this lizard business he won’t think of anything
else. Now we’ll stick by him until the train
leaves. Once he’s up in the mountains, hunting
for lizards that don’t exist, we’ll be safe. We’ll
have the land in our possession in a few days.”</p>

<p>The two conspirators took the note the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had written. Then, never leaving him for
an instant, they got him ready for his trip to the
mountains, where Fussel really did own a hunting
cabin. It was unoccupied, and was to be
placed at the disposal of the professor.</p>

<p>“There you are now!” exclaimed Fussel, as
he and Professor Bailey went to the station with
Dr. Snodgrass. “Just in time for the train.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t forget to send for my things
at Mrs. Hopkins’s house?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“We’ll attend to that,” promised Bailey.</p>

<p>“And you’ll tell her and the boys, why I had
to leave so hurriedly—in order that I might not
miss a chance to get those lizards; will you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ll tell them,” glibly promised
Fussel.</p>

<p>The train pulled in. The professor was hurried
aboard with some articles of wearing apparel
hastily provided for him.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have to hustle you off in this way,”
said Fussel, as the train pulled out, “but you
really had no time to go to Cresville, you see.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” added his fellow conspirator.
“Those lizards are scary things. They’re here
to-day and gone to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to send on my things!” cried
the professor from the car window, “and don’t
neglect to tell the boys to come and see me!”</p>

<p>“Where do you imagine he’s keeping himself?”</p>

<p>“Give it up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s after bugs—you can make up your
mind to that. Bugs or that two-tailed lizard.”</p>

<p>Thus Jerry asked a question, and Ned and Bob,
in turn, answered it. The three motor boys were
seated on the porch of Jerry’s house one warm
summer day, about a week after Professor Snodgrass’s
departure to Bellport. Since then they
had seen nothing of him, and had only heard
from him in that first brief note.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s going with us he’d better get a
move on,” observed Ned, idly whittling a stick.
“We want to leave by the end of this week if
we can.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Bob. “And I say,
Jerry, I hope you have mapped out our route so
it won’t be too far between eats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had you in mind all the while, Chunky,”
laughed the tall lad. “There’s a restaurant, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
corner grocery, about every five miles, and that
ought to be close enough for you.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Don’t get fresh!” retorted Bob, who
resented too pointed references to his eating propensity.</p>

<p>“No, but speaking seriously,” put in Ned,
“the professor ought to be on hand if he is going
with us. And I suppose he will want to
go,” he added. “He hasn’t missed a trip since
we went to Mexico. Say, there were some doings
then!” he exclaimed with a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>“Oh, we may have just as much fun and excitement
now,” commented Jerry. “We’ve got a
long trip mapped out. And, if the professor
doesn’t want to come with us, I suppose we’ll
have to go without him. Though it’s more fun
when he’s along.”</p>

<p>The boys had, as Jerry intimated, planned a
trip for their summer vacation. It was to be
made partly in their big auto, and partly by motor
boat, and several hundred miles would be covered.
They intended to tour the upper part of
New York State, and end with a long voyage on
Lake Champlain, whither their motor boat would
be sent. But the unexpected delay caused by Professor
Snodgrass remaining at Bellport had rather
hampered them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with taking a trip over
there and seeing what’s keeping him?” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Ned, after a pause. “He’ll be glad to see us,
and, if he hasn’t caught that two-tailed lizard yet,
he may be glad to change his base of operations.
Let’s take a run over in the car. It isn’t far.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” agreed Jerry. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” half-grunted Bob, for he was
chewing gum, probably as a substitute for eating.</p>

<p>“Well, as long as we’ve made up our minds
to hunt up the professor,” said Jerry, “we might
as well make a full day of it, and go out to the
swamp. I want to look around there.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good?” asked Ned. “Your
mother has sold the land; hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s gone, and I suppose I ought to
be satisfied with the price she got,” spoke the tall
lad. “But, somehow, I can’t get over the notion
that there’s something back of it all. Those
fellows weren’t square and above-board, I’m positive
of that.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean they cheated you?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,”
replied Jerry, slowly. “They paid mother what
they agreed to; but it was their veiled threats as
to what they’d do if she didn’t sell that made me
mad. They practically forced her to dispose of
that land, though I’m not saying but what the
condition of her money matters might not have
made her sell it anyhow.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve a notion I’d like to see how things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
are going out there, and whether those fellows
are really draining the place as they said they
were. Come on. It won’t take long to go there
in the boat, and then we’ll make the trip to Bellport
in the auto.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” assented Ned. “Only you
know your mother doesn’t own any land there
now, and we may be ordered off as trespassers.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take that chance,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p>A little later, in the motor boat, they were
winding their way up Cabbage Creek.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t changed much,” observed Bob, as
they came within sight of the swamp. “There’s
as much muddy water as ever, in spite of their
drainage ditches.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure they were drainage ditches,”
observed Jerry, who was at the wheel.</p>

<p>The boat swung around a bend in the sluggish
stream, and as it did so Ned uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Look!” he shouted. “They’ll never let us
land there!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a large sign, and, even from
where they were, the boys could read that all
trespassers were warned off under the “full penalty
of the law.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” grumbled Jerry. “They didn’t lose
any time. I wonder what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go as near as we can and see,” suggested
Bob, and he steered the boat to the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
landing place. But that was as far as it could
go. Barbed wire stretched across the right of
way by which Mrs. Hopkins’s land had formerly
been reached, and there was another sign which
warned trespassers away.</p>

<p>Across the swamp a number of men, with big
rubber boots, and long-handled shovels, could be
seen working. And it needed no very intent observer
to see that they were taking out quantities
of the yellow clay. It was not excavating work
at all; it was more like mining—mining for mud.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” remarked Jerry. “But
what’s it good for? That’s what gets me. What
in the world are they doing with it?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s for us to find out,” spoke Ned.
“We can’t go any closer, that’s evident.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Jerry, in a low voice.</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a movement among the
diggers, and a figure detached itself from among
them and came forward.</p>

<p>“For the love of stamps!” cried Bob. “Look
who’s here—Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>It was indeed the old enemy of the motor boys
who was advancing toward them. They had not
seen him in some months—not since the last
time he had made trouble for them.</p>

<p>“Hey! You fellows want to clear out of
here!” said Noddy, with his supercilious air.
“Vamoose, or you’ll be arrested!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, is that so? Who says so?” returned
Bob.</p>

<p>“I say so!” and Noddy bristled up like an
angry rooster. “This is private land, and I
order you away.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Ned, with a laugh.
“Seems to me we’ve seen you before.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get fresh!” advised Noddy. “I’m in
charge here, and I order you away. This land
belongs to the Universal Plaster Company, and
I’m assistant foreman. They made me that when
they bought my father’s swamp land. Now you
get away!”</p>

<p>“What’s the row, Noddy?” asked a voice, and
the boys saw Fussel coming toward their enemy.</p>

<p>“These fellows won’t get away!” blustered
Noddy.</p>

<p>“I should say we wouldn’t!” snapped Jerry.
“This creek is public property, and we have a
right to be here.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you come on this land!”</p>

<p>“Wait until we do, before you order us off,”
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“They aren’t on our property, Noddy,” observed
Fussel, quietly. “You boys can read, I
suppose?” he asked, and his voice was a bit
sharp.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve been to school,” replied Ned,
easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, just observe what the sign says—that’s
all,” the foreman went on. “You haven’t any
rights here now, you know,” he said, addressing
Jerry.</p>

<p>“And we don’t intend to claim any,” was
Jerry’s answer. “At least not now.” There was
a significance in his tone that made Fussel look
at him in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t need to stand guard,
Noddy,” went on the foreman, “and I need you
over at the work. Come on.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry. We won’t take any of
your yellow clay,” called out Jerry.</p>

<p>“You’d better not!” blustered Noddy. “That
clay is——”</p>

<p>“That’ll do!” interrupted Fussel, sharply.
“Go back where you belong,” and Noddy, rather
taken down by this rebuke, slunk off.</p>

<p>Fussel, as though he knew the signs would not
be disregarded, had turned away, and Jerry, after
standing up in the boat, so as to get a good view
of the men digging in the yellow mud, threw in
the clutch and started the craft on her return
trip.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you imagine that yellow
clay is good for, Jerry?” Ned remarked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea in the world, but I’m
going to find out. Professor Snodgrass said it
was valueless, but he may have been mistaken.
I’m going to find out what it is good for.”</p>

<small>“WE’VE BEEN TRICKED!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sending the motor boat along slowly, for they
were in no especial hurry, the boys discussed the
experience through which they had just passed.</p>

<p>“Imagine finding Noddy Nixon there!” exclaimed
Bob. “Next thing we know Bill Berry
will be showing up.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see him there,” observed Ned.
“He’d probably be among the laborers, if he
were there at all. But you wouldn’t catch Noddy
soiling his hands in the clay. The job of assistant
foreman is about his limit.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so much surprised at seeing him, for
the company bought part of his father’s land,”
spoke Jerry. “But what gets me is that clay!
It’s queer they should find a use for it.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure they have?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re taking it out carefully enough,”
responded the tall lad, “and they wouldn’t do
that if it didn’t have some value. We’ve got to
get busy on this. But don’t say anything to my
mother, or she might feel as though she had done
wrong in selling the land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there any chance of her getting it back, in
case it develops that there is a valuable deposit
of mineral, or something else on it?” Bob wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” Jerry answered. “But I’m
going to have Professor Snodgrass make another
examination of the yellow clay.”</p>

<p>“How you going to get any of it?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got some of the first lump left yet.
I’ll have him experiment on that. He didn’t make
a very exhaustive test before. I’ll take some to
Bellport when we go over this afternoon.”</p>

<p>But the boys were disappointed in their search
for Professor Snodgrass at Bellport. As we
know, he had already left the hotel there, being
hastened on his way by the conspirators, for reasons
of their own.</p>

<p>“No, the professor ain’t here, boys,” drawled
Ike Rossiter, proprietor of the Mansion House,
where the scientist had written that he was making
his headquarters.</p>

<p>“Where did he go?” asked Jerry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mr. Rossiter. “But
I wish I did.”</p>

<p>“Why—does he owe you money?” Ned wanted
to know, for the professor was sometimes in
the habit of absent-mindedly going off without
paying his bills, and the boys, several times, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
made up the deficiency, for which he reimbursed
them later.</p>

<p>“No, he don’t owe me a cent,” said Mr. Rossiter.
“Oh, he’s honest enough, as far as that’s
concerned.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you want him?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“’Cause he left behind a box of funny bugs,”
answered the hotel proprietor, “and every woman
servant in the place is so nervous, for fear they’ll
get loose and bite ’em, that they can’t do their
work half properly. Great big black bugs they
are, in a wire box. The professor left ’em behind
in his room, and I had ’em brought down
to the office. I don’t want to turn ’em loose, for
fear he might want ’em and bring suit against me
for losin’ ’em. I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take charge of them for you,” volunteered
Jerry. “We expect to see the professor
soon. But can’t you give us any idea of where
he has gone?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, boys. He left here suddenly,
with a couple of men, and all I heard ’em
talkin’ about was a two-headed lizard, as if there
was any such critter.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a two-tailed lizard?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it was,” admitted the hotel man.
“I didn’t pay no attention. But if you’ll take
them bugs away I’ll be much obliged. They’re
big, fuzzy things, and they look dangerous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys readily assumed charge of the specimens
the professor had forgotten in his haste, but
further questioning failed to bring out any information
as to his whereabouts.</p>

<p>“He must have gotten some clue, or what he
thought was a clue, to the location of the lizards,”
observed Jerry, “and he started after them in
his usual hurry. He’ll be back again soon. But
I don’t like the idea of waiting for him. It will
upset all our vacation plans.”</p>

<p>“Then why wait for him?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want to leave without him,
after we half promised to take him with us.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that,” went on Ned. “But
let’s trail him.”</p>

<p>“Trail him? How can we?” asked Ned.
“We haven’t the least idea where he went.”</p>

<p>“No, but we might find out,” resumed the stout
youth. “He would probably leave word at his
home, near Boston, where he could be reached.
He’d want his mail forwarded, too. You can be
pretty sure that his housekeeper knows his address.</p>

<p>“Now what’s the matter with us starting our
trip, and calling at his residence? We’re almost
sure to get some information about him there.
And you can bring along that specimen of yellow
clay, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Bob! We’ll do it!” cried the
tall lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Further questioning of the hotel man brought
out little that was of value. Professor Snodgrass
had been seen with two strangers in Bellport, but
only a meager description of them could be obtained.
No one had paid much attention to them.
And beyond the fact that the professor had been
seen taking a northern-bound train, nothing further
was known of his destination. The ticket
agent could not remember to what destination the
scientist had purchased a ticket.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go to his home, and start the
search there,” decided Jerry, as he put in the
auto the lump of yellow clay, and the box of bugs.</p>

<p>Preparations for the boys’ trip were quickly
made, and a few days later they were ready to
start. And then came a disclosure that had a
startling effect.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned were at Jerry’s house, the evening
before the start. They were going over the
final details, to see that they had omitted nothing,
when Ned, who was looking over a New York
paper, uttered a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Lots!” cried Ned. “If this isn’t your yellow
clay stuff, Jerry, I’m mistaken!”</p>

<p>He pointed to a large advertisement of the
Universal Plaster Company, in which was announced
the discovery of a new medicinal agent.
It was a plaster, or poultice, which it was claimed
would work wonders with sores, swellings, aches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pains and other maladies. And, amid a mass of
other information, were set down the facts that
the preparation was harmless, being composed of
medicated clay from “the vicinity of Cresville,
Mass., where are located the largest and only
beds of this valuable earth in the world.”</p>

<p>The advertisement went on to tell how the clay
had accidentally been discovered, and how, after
many experiments, it was found that it could be
mixed with medicinal agents that rendered it very
valuable. The successful efforts of the company
to get control of the whole available supply were
noted, and there were appended to the advertisement
testimonials from many well-known physicians.</p>

<p>“And look there!” cried Ned, pointing to the
extract from a scientist’s letter. “Professor
Snodgrass says he has analyzed the clay, and
found it exceedingly valuable for the purpose intended.
See, there’s a fac-simile of his signature
boys!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” spoke Bob, slowly.</p>

<p>Jerry looked at the professor’s printed letter.
Then, as he took in the import of the advertisement,
and realized how his mother had sold the
valuable clay land for a tenth of its present value,
the tall lad exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Boys, we’ve been tricked! Professor Snodgrass
has double-crossed us!” And he banged
the table with his fist.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>ON THE BRINK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It is a hard matter to know, or even fear, that
a faithful friend has been unfaithful, particularly
so when one is young and rather unsophisticated.
It is no small matter then to have one’s ideals
shattered.</p>

<p>And it was thus with Jerry and his chums when
they read the advertisement of the Universal
Plaster Company, and saw the indorsement of
Professor Snodgrass, concerning the value of the
yellow clay, which was given a high-sounding
medical name, based on the Latin term.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass has betrayed us!” went
on Jerry, still in a heat of passion. “He knew
all the while that the yellow clay was valuable,
and yet, when I asked him to analyze it, he said
it was worthless. And he knew there was a
deposit of it on mother’s land.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure about that?” asked Ned slowly.</p>

<p>“Sure? Of course I am! Didn’t I tell him
so when I showed him the clay? I told him where
it came from, and he said all the good he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
see in it was for filling. Now he goes and helps
these fellows made a medicine of it. He’s double-crossed
us, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“It does look so,” admitted Bob, who was
rather more likely than Ned to agree with the
more positive speaker—in this case Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“My, what’s all the excitement about?” asked
Mrs. Hopkins, coming into the room at this juncture.
“Has something gone wrong with your
plans?”</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke, and then Jerry
said:</p>

<p>“Something has gone wrong, Mother, but
not exactly with our plans. Look here,” and he
showed her the advertisement. She read it
through without remark. Over her shoulder
Jerry saw some statements that had escaped him
at first.</p>

<p>These were to the effect that several cures of
stubborn ailments had been effected by the yellow
clay, and the medicines with which it was impregnated.
The clay was of medicinal value in
itself, it was claimed, but it was rendered more efficacious
by the introduction of other chemicals.</p>

<p>Rheumatism, swellings, pains, aches and ailments
of various sorts yielded to its application,
and the names of well-known medical men bore
out the claims of the Universal Plaster Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“And to think that the most of that clay was
on your land, Mother, and you have sold it!”
cried Jerry, when she looked up from the paper.</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be helped now, Jerry,” she answered,
quietly. “What’s done is done.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that!” cried Jerry,
pacing up and down the room. “I think Professor
Snodgrass cheated us in not telling me the
clay was valuable.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did not know it,” suggested Mrs.
Hopkins. “I am sure the professor would never
do anything dishonorable.”</p>

<p>“Look at that!” demanded Jerry, pointing to
the letter of the scientist—a letter appearing over
his own signature—in which the claims for the
clay were substantiated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins could not answer. Certainly it
looked as though the scientific friend of the boys
had acted against their interests—or, at least,
against the interests of the Hopkins family.</p>

<p>“And just think, Mother!” cried Jerry, “if
we owned that land now we could sell the clay
ourselves, and get back some of the fortune you
have lost.”</p>

<p>“It sure is tough luck,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“And that’s where the professor has been all
this while—working in with those fellows,” declared
Bob. “He’s been helping them get this
clay ready for the market, and we thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was after the two-tailed lizards all the while. I
wouldn’t have believed it of him!”</p>

<p>“Why do so?” asked Mrs. Hopkins gently.
“Everyone is presumed to be innocent until
proven guilty. Why not give the professor a
‘show for his white alley,’ as I often hear you
boys say? Why condemn him unheard? That
isn’t fair!”</p>

<p>Jerry blushed.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it isn’t, Mother,” he admitted,
“but the facts are all against him. Didn’t I give
him a chance to tell us the clay was valuable before
we sold the land?”</p>

<p>“I know, but there may have been some mistake.
Science is not always accurate.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Ned. “Lots of times
the professor has been mistaken when he tried to
find a certain kind of bug where all the books
said it was sure to be. Why not give him another
chance, Jerry? Maybe this is all a fake,” and
he pointed to the advertisement.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look so,” returned the tall lad.
“Still, it isn’t any fun for me to believe the professor
helped to swindle us. I’d a heap sight
rather find out it was all a mistake. And, as you
say, I’m willing to give him another chance. But
how can we do it?”</p>

<p>“Follow up our original plan,” suggested
Bob. “Go to his home and see him. If he isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
there, they may know where he is, and we can
follow him. That’s what I’m in favor of.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” exclaimed Jerry. “The
majority rules. We’ll go find the professor. But
it’s a hard thing to believe him against us—a
hard thing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it, dear,” suggested Mrs. Hopkins
in her gentle voice. “Just suspend judgment.
I am sure it will all come out right.”</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“And, if it doesn’t,” went on his mother,
“money isn’t everything in this world. We shall
live, even without the money we might have had
from the sale of this yellow clay, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do hate to be cheated and fooled!”
he answered. “Noddy Nixon is laughing at us
now, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Let him!” advised Ned. “He laughs best
who has the last inning, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe—yes. Anyhow, we’ve got our
work cut out for us for some time ahead.”</p>

<p>Jerry sat down to read the advertisement over
again. There was little to be extracted from it
save to confirm the first impression. There was
told how the clay was accidentally discovered, and
how, after much experimenting, a medicinal use
was found for it. Then the efforts of the company
to get control of all the available supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were detailed; but nothing was said of the forceful
efforts made to induce Mrs. Hopkins to sign
away her rights, of which she was in ignorance at
the time of making the deed.</p>

<p>“I suppose, legally, they are within their
rights,” remarked Jerry, “but, morally, they are
not. But I’ll wait and see what the professor
says. It looks bad for him; but maybe, after all,
he is innocent. He’s a regular kid when it comes
to some things, and those fellows may have ‘put
one over on him’ without his knowing anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” cried Ned. “I
can’t believe the dear old professor would go back
on us.”</p>

<p>As their preparations were nearly completed,
nothing more was done that night. Jerry’s two
chums would meet at his house the next morning,
and in the auto would make the journey to
the home of the professor, in the vicinity of
Boston.</p>

<p>“When will you be back?” asked Mrs. Hopkins,
as the motor boys started away in their
powerful machine.</p>

<p>“No telling, Mother,” answered Jerry, blowing
her a kiss. Then he slipped in the gear
lever, let the clutch engage, and they were off.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, the roads good and the
boys had nothing at present before them but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
trip to the professor’s house. They expected to
reach it early that afternoon.</p>

<p>But they counted without accidents. It seemed
that Fate had it “in for them.”</p>

<p>Engine trouble developed before they had gone
thirty miles, and as they were near no garage they
attempted to locate the difficulty themselves, as
they had often done. The mischief seemed to
be in the carbureter, and it took an hour to remedy
it.</p>

<p>“Whew! Some work!” cried Bob, for they
had to labor over the engine in a hot sun. “Let’s
pull up in the shade and eat!” suggested the
stout lad, for they had brought along a liberal
luncheon.</p>

<p>“A little of that ice-cold lemonade from the
vacuum bottle!” sighed Ned. “It is some
warm!”</p>

<p>Jerry smiled indulgently, and, a little later the
boys were seated in the auto, beneath the shade
of a big maple, enjoying a well-earned rest.</p>

<p>But this was not the end of their troubles, for
first one tire, and then another, blew out, necessitating
the use of two spare shoes they carried,
so that when they had finally passed through Boston,
and were on the road to the town where the
professor lived, it was getting dusk.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to stay all night,” commented
Jerry, as he switched on the electric lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
peered at the road ahead. It was not the best
highway they had encountered, either, being uphill,
and in poor condition.</p>

<p>“Looks like a shower,” commented Bob.</p>

<p>It grew rapidly darker, due to the fast-gathering
clouds, and a few drops of rain fell.</p>

<p>“We’re in for it,” cried Ned. “Better get the
top up, Jerry, old man.”</p>

<p>“All right. Just as soon as we get around the
turn in the road.”</p>

<p>The lights of the car showed a bend just ahead
of them. It was a road the boys had never traveled
before and Jerry was taking no chances.</p>

<p>Suddenly a vivid flash of lightning, followed
by a sharp clap of thunder, startled the boys. At
the same moment every electric light in the car
went out.</p>

<p>Whether the sudden darkness, following the
vivid flash, confused Jerry, or whether, involuntarily,
he twisted the steering wheel, was not
made certain. But, an instant later the big car
gave a lurch, and in the light of the next flash
the boys saw, with horror, that they were headed
for the edge of the road, where a frail wooden
rail alone separated the highway from a sheer
descent. <a href="#image01">The car poised for an instant, the front
wheels on the very brink</a>, while, all about the
thunder crashed, the lightning blinded them, and
the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry had instinctively jammed on both the
foot and the hand emergency brake as he felt
the big car slipping. It came as natural to do
this as it does to one to put out his hands when
he is falling. Jerry had been in too many tight
places not to know what to do when confronted
with sudden danger.</p>

<p>And the brake bands had not ceased their shrill
squeaking, which could be heard above the roar
of the storm, before Ned and Bob yelled in
chorus:</p>

<p>“Hold her, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“I am holding her,” was the grim response.
“And don’t you fellows move too suddenly, or
we’ll go over. Get out as easily as you can while
the getting’s good!”</p>

<p>“What—what happened?” panted Bob, between
thunder claps, as he peered ahead to see
by the intermittent lightning what their position
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s almost over the brink—that’s what happened,”
answered Jerry. “I don’t know whether
she’s going to stay here or not. Get out, while
you can, and we’ll decide what to do.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got a rope and a pulley,” volunteered
Ned. “We may be able to haul her back on the
road.”</p>

<p>“The first thing is to get out and save ourselves,”
were Jerry’s next words. “Then we can
talk about what to do. Open the side doors carefully,
fellows, and step out as lightly as you can.
The least jar may send her over.”</p>

<p>It was a perilous position, but the boys kept
their heads. Jerry remained at the wheel, his
hands gripping the wooden rim as though his very
grasp could hold the ponderous car from slipping
into the chasm revealed by the lightning flashes.</p>

<p>Then Ned on his side, and Bob on his, cautiously
opened the doors of the tonneau, and
stepped down. As soon as they were out from
under the shelter of the canopy they were
drenched by the pelting rain that stung their faces.</p>

<p>“All right?” asked Jerry, from his seat.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Get some stones, then, to block the rear
wheels,” directed the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to get out?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what I am,” was the reply. “I wanted
to wait until you fellows were out, though.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Too much motion at once might start her over the
edge.”</p>

<p>And, not until then did it occur to Bob and
Ned what an act of heroism Jerry had performed
in staying in his place until they were safe.</p>

<p>He might have leaped at the first intimation of
danger, for he was in a position to do this more
easily than either of his chums. But he had stuck
to his post, doing what he could to hold the car
in place, until the others were out of danger.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned said nothing at the time. But
later they gave Jerry to understand that they appreciated
his pluck and self-sacrifice, though the
latter was not fully consummated. But it was
characteristic of Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Whew! How it rains!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk—get some stones and block the
wheels, Chunky!” directed Ned.</p>

<p>By this time Jerry, yanking back the emergency
brake lever to the last possible notch, in order to
keep the car from slipping, cautiously made his
way to the side of his chums. Bob and Ned had
managed to find, by the lightning flashes, two
large rocks, which were wedged in front of each
of the rear wheels.</p>

<p>“I guess that’ll hold her,” remarked Jerry,
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know about that sharp turn,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
replied Jerry, “and I didn’t swing her around
soon enough. She went right through that guard
rail—it doesn’t amount to a toothpick, anyhow—and
I got the brakes on her just in time. The
lightning showed me where I was going. Otherwise
we’d be down there at the bottom of the
gulch, and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about it!” begged Ned, with an
involuntary shudder. “It’s too horrible!”</p>

<p>For a moment the three motor boys stood in
the storm, their faces, each time it lightened, showing
the fear they felt at their narrow escape.</p>

<p>Then Bob spoke.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” he asked. “We
can’t stay here all night in this rain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what else we’re going to do,”
Jerry answered. “We don’t want to desert the
car, and we don’t want to go to sleep in her. She
might come loose any moment. Guess we’ll have
to camp out here, and make the best of it.
’Twon’t be the first time we’ve roughed it.”</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t see any necessity for it,”
spoke Ned. “We have a strong rope in the tool
box—a wire cable—and we can take a turn about
the rear axle with that, and fasten it to a tree.
Then the car can’t slide over, especially if we put
plenty of blocking stones in front of the wheels.
In fact we could brace the car up enough so
that it would be safe to stay in her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hardly that,” said Jerry. “We’d have a
nightmare, give a jump and start her going,
I’m thinking. But maybe we can fasten it with
the wire rope so that she will be safe until morning.
Let’s try, anyhow. Then we can take the
robes, and our raincoats, and make a sort of shelter
in the woods. If we only had something to
eat it wouldn’t be so bad. I wonder if we could
find a place where we could get a bite?”</p>

<p>“I—I’ve got some lunch stowed away,” said
Bob, half apologetically, as though he feared
being censured. “I thought maybe we’d get hungry
before supper, so I brought along some grub,
and there’s a vacuum bottle of coffee with it.
That ought to be hot.”</p>

<p>“Chunky, you’re a bird!” cried Ned. “Never
again will I rig you about the eats. Lead me to
’em!”</p>

<p>“Fix the car first!” ordered Jerry. “We
can’t take any chances with that.”</p>

<p>Working cautiously, so as not to jar the automobile,
and start it over the brink, the boys, disregarding
the drenching rain, got out the thin
wire rope, which they carried in case they might
need a tow, and fastened it to the rear axle and
then to a big tree, pulling the cable taut.</p>

<p>“That ought to hold her,” said Jerry. “But
we’ll pile some more stones in front of the
wheels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Not until this was done, and the car made as
secure as possible, did the boys get their raincoats
and blankets from the space under the seats. By
this time they were pretty well drenched. But the
night was a warm one, and their condition was
not as unpleasant as it might otherwise have been.</p>

<p>“Now for the eats!” cried Ned. “Pile ’em
out, Bob.”</p>

<p>With some of the auto robes they made a rude
sort of shelter among the trees, and one of the oil
lamps, carried on the car for emergency, made the
place a little light. The red tail lamp of the auto
was sufficient to warn other travelers that the
road was partly blocked.</p>

<p>“Though I don’t believe anyone will come up
here in this storm,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>The hot coffee from the vacuum bottle, and
the sandwiches which Bob had provided, made
them all feel better.</p>

<p>“Though it’s no fun to stand all this drenching,”
said Ned. “Now that the car is safe I
vote we go up or down the road and see if we
can’t find a hotel or some place to stay the rest
of the night.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jerry, “we’d better stay here, near
the car. No telling what might happen.”</p>

<p>“Then what’s the matter with getting in the
car?” asked Bob. “The canopy will shelter us.”</p>

<p>“No,” again said the tall lad, “it’s too risky.
The chances are that the car won’t go over, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I’m not going to take the one chance that might
be against us. It won’t be long until morning,
and then we can see what needs to be done.”</p>

<p>But the wet night was miserable enough for all
of them. Their shelter gave little protection
against the downpour which kept up until nearly
morning, and they were tired and cramped from
the positions they had to occupy. But no one
found much fault, though all were glad when a
faint light in the east told of the coming of the
dawn.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to see, they inspected
the position of the car. It was perilous
enough, and the rising sun showed how near they
had come to going over the brink.</p>

<p>“Can we pull her back?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>But they could not move the machine, which
had settled in the mud.</p>

<p>“It’ll take a team of horses,” decided Jerry.
“Now that we can see the car isn’t in any danger
of going over, we can go for help.”</p>

<p>“One of us had better stay,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>Making sure that the car would not slip, Bob
and Jerry started down the road, intending to hire
a team from the nearest farmer. Ned was left
on guard.</p>

<p>The appearance of Bob and Jerry, from having
camped out in the rain all night, was not very
prepossessing, and the farmer’s wife, to whom
they applied for horses, looked at them askance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
But the sight of some bills in Jerry’s hand
changed her rather glum face to a smiling one,
and the farmer, returning from his early milking,
readily agreed to take his team and haul the auto
back to the road.</p>

<p>“And while we’re here, hadn’t we better eat?”
suggested Bob, in a whisper to Jerry. “We can
take Ned back some grub, too.”</p>

<p>Fortified by a substantial meal, the boys could
look on their adventure with better spirits now.
Ned was grateful for his portion, and with the
help of the farmer and his horses the car was
soon back on the highway. No damage had been
done to it, and, after paying the man for his
services, the boys were soon under way again.</p>

<p>A little later they entered the driveway of the
home of Professor Snodgrass, having stopped at
a hotel on the way for a wash and change of
clothes, which garments they carried with them.</p>

<p>“The professor? No, he isn’t here,” replied
the housekeeper, after she had greeted the boys,
whom she knew well. “He hasn’t been here since
he went to Cresville.”</p>

<p>“But where is he?” asked Jerry, quickly.</p>

<p>“He’s somewhere in the Maine mountains,”
was the answer. “He’s after a two-tailed lizard,
and he doesn’t know when he’ll be back.”</p>

<small>ON THE TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Disappointment showed plainly on the faces
of the three motor boys. They looked at one
another, and then at Mrs. Johnson, the housekeeper.
She could not mistake their feeling.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Mrs. Johnson remarked. “If
he had known you were coming to see him, I’m
sure he would have waited for you. But I understood
him to say, when he left here, that he was
going to call on you boys, and get you to go with
him.”</p>

<p>“He did call on me,” explained Jerry, “but
he left suddenly to make a search for some specimens,
and did not return. We supposed he came
back here.”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” the housekeeper answered,
“though he sent me a letter in which he said he
was going to the mountains, and for me not to
worry about him.</p>

<p>“But I always do that, when he’s off on one
of his queer trips,” went on Mrs. Johnson, with
a sigh. “I never know what danger he may get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
into. I don’t fuss so much when I know he is
with you boys, for I know you’ll sort of look
after him. But when he’s by himself he’d just
as soon get wet through and never change his
things from one day to another. He is so
thoughtless!</p>

<p>“And now it is such a queer search he is on.
A two-tailed lizard! As if there could be any
such thing as that. Oh dear! I don’t know what
to do!”</p>

<p>“Well, the professor has found queerer things
than two-tailed lizards,” remarked Jerry, “so
that part is all right. But I can’t understand
about his going away without saying a word to
us. That’s what makes it seem queer.”</p>

<p>“It sure does,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he want you to go with him?” Mrs.
Johnson wanted to know.</p>

<p>“He didn’t give us a chance to say,” was Bob’s
answer. “He just—disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Have you his address?” asked Jerry of the
housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Hurdtown, but you’ll wait a good
while before you can get an answer from there.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s miles away from a railroad, and
in a lonely part of the mountains. I have written
once to the professor since he sent me word where
he was going, but I haven’t heard from him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurdtown,” observed Jerry. “I wonder
how we could get there?”</p>

<p>“Are you going after him?” the housekeeper
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I think so—yes,” replied Jerry. “I want to
see him on important business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” Mrs. Johnson cried. “He
just needs you boys, I know he does! I can’t
understand his going away without you. Please
find him, and here—take these dry socks to him.
I know he’ll go about with wet feet.”</p>

<p>Jerry smiled as he took the socks, and then
his face grew grave. He was thinking of the
yellow mud of the swamp, and wondering what
Professor Snodgrass would say when asked why
he had told Jerry it was worthless, and why,
later, he had indorsed it as of great value.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson brought out the professor’s letter.
It was short, as his epistles always were, and
merely stated that he had gotten on the track of
a two-tailed lizard. He gave his address simply
as Hurdtown, Maine.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to go after him!” decided
Ned, “and the sooner we start the better. I
wonder where this place is, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I looked it up on the map,” said the housekeeper
eagerly. “I can show it to you.”</p>

<p>Hurdtown appeared to be in the northern part
of New England, several hundred miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Boston, and in a lonely section, poorly supplied
with railroad facilities.</p>

<p>“Yes, we could get there,” decided Jerry,
looking at the map. “We could best make it by
road and river, as well as by some lake travel.
See,” he went on, tracing out a route with a
pencil. “We could go up that far in the auto,
leave the car there, and make the rest of the trip
in the motor boat. That river would take us
nearly to Hurdtown, and we could finish up with
a lake trip.”</p>

<p>“Shall we do it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m willing, if you are,” assented Jerry.
“I sure do want to have a talk with the professor.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be an all-right jaunt; merely as
a trip,” said Ned slowly, “and of course we’ll
stand by you, Jerry. But I don’t see how we’re
going to do any water traveling—not with our
motor boat, anyhow. We can’t haul it along behind
the auto very well.”</p>

<p>“No, but we could ship it on in advance, and
have it waiting for us at the head of Silver River.
Then we can go down that to Lake Mogan and
so on to Hurdtown. It will be quite a trip, but
maybe we’ll enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“Enjoy it! I should say we would!” cried
Bob. “We can take along a lot of things to eat,
and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped as he saw his chums smiling at him.
A flicker of amusement also came into the face
of Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly will be glad if you boys can
locate the professor,” she said. “Tell him I
was quite worried about him. But then I don’t
s’pose that will do any good—he’ll do just the
same thing next time—or worse. But you can
send me word how he is when you find him, and
that’s more than he’d do. When he writes all he
thinks about is his bugs, and he’ll write and tell
me how many of such-and-such an insect he has.
He gives them their Latin names, and he might
just as well talk Italian to me. But you boys will
look after him; won’t you?”</p>

<p>“We sure will!” exclaimed Jerry. In spite of
the feeling he had that Dr. Snodgrass had not
played fair with him, the tall lad could not forget
the affection he had for the absent-minded
scientist.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to make that long trip
we’d better set about it,” spoke Ned. “We’ll
have to go home and make preparations, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” broke in Bob. “It’ll take a lot
of grub——”</p>

<p>“Can’t you think of anything else, Chunky?”
asked Jerry, with a smile. “Of course we’ll have
to make some plans,” he went on, “and arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to ship the motor boat. We’d better get busy,
I guess.”</p>

<p>They said good-bye to Mrs. Johnson, and, a
little later, were on their way back home in the
auto. The visit to the professor’s house had detained
them somewhat, as Mrs. Johnson insisted
that they stay to dinner.</p>

<p>“We can’t make Cresville by night,” observed
Ned, looking at his watch, when they were on
the road. Ned was at the wheel.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll stay at a hotel until morning, after
we cover as much ground as we care to,” decided
Jerry. “No use taking any chances with night
travel.”</p>

<p>They had said nothing to Mrs. Johnson about
their reasons for wanting to see the professor,
and to his original one, of merely desiring an
explanation about the yellow clay, Jerry had
added another.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “I’m not so sure but what
mother could claim that she was fraudulently induced
to sell that land. It wasn’t a square deal,
anyhow, and maybe the professor, unless he’s too
friendly with that Universal Plaster Company,
could give evidence in our favor.”</p>

<p>“What good would it do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, if we could prove that the sale of the
land was brought about by fraud, the transfer
would be set aside,” Jerry said. “Mother could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have her property again, and get a profit from
the medicated mud. I only hope it will turn out
that way.”</p>

<p>“And you think the professor can help you?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He may be able to. I can’t believe that he’s
gone back on me altogether, though it does look
so.”</p>

<p>Discussing this subject made the time pass
quickly for the boys, and soon they had arrived
at a hotel where, once before, they had put up
over night.</p>

<p>“We’ll stay here,” decided Jerry, “and go on
in the morning.”</p>

<p>At supper that evening Bob called Jerry’s attention
to an advertisement in the paper, extolling
the virtues of the yellow clay for rheumatism and
other ills.</p>

<p>“Don’t take my appetite away, Chunky!”
begged Jerry. “I don’t want to think about it
until I have to. And yet, with it all, I can’t believe
the professor has betrayed us.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins, after some thought, consented
to the plans of her son and his chums.</p>

<p>“I know you will be careful,” she said,
“though I have not much hope that you will
accomplish anything. I haven’t the least idea
that Professor Snodgrass is at fault. He is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that sort of a character. There has been some
mistake, I am sure. But the trip may do you
good, even if you don’t get my land back, Jerry,”
and she smiled at her impulsive son.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give the professor a chance to explain,
anyhow,” the tall lad remarked. “One
funny thing about it is that he hasn’t sent for
the things he left here. I should think he’d want
them. There are some specimens, and his
clothes. I wonder——”</p>

<p>Jerry was interrupted by a ring at the door. A
servant came back with a note.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Jerry, as he noted the
writing on the envelope, “it’s from Professor
Snodgrass himself!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s coming back!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Or maybe it’s an explanation,” said Bob.</p>

<p>But it was neither, as Jerry discovered when
he opened it. It was merely a request that the
professor’s possessions at the Hopkins house be
sent to an address he gave.</p>

<p>“I am off after a two-tailed lizard,” the scientist
wrote. “I’ll see you boys later. No time
to come and say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Humph! He was in something of a hurry,”
observed Jerry.</p>

<p>The note thus delivered was the one Professor
Snodgrass had written at the instigation of Fussel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and his fellow conspirator, who had used the scientist
for their own ends. They had held back
his communication until it pleased them to have
it delivered. They now thought they had matters
in their own hands. Of course Jerry and
his chums had no means of knowing this.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll send his things, of course,” Jerry
decided. “Or, rather, we’ll take them to him
ourselves. We can do it as quickly as they would
go to him by express. Come on, boys, let’s hustle
and get on the trail.”</p>

<p>The motor boat was sent by freight to the
headwaters of Silver River, and then the boys
spent a few days getting their own outfit ready
to take with them in their auto.</p>

<p>“Say, I wish you’d take me!” cried Andy Rush,
when he heard something of the prospective trip.
“I’d help—do the cooking—bring the water—rustle
the wood—stand guard—Noddy Nixon
might try some of his funny tricks—I’d stand him
off—take me along—I need a vacation—I’ll pump
up the tires—whoop!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got enough hot air—that’s sure—to
pump up a dozen tires, Andy,” said Jerry. “But
it can’t be done!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>A STOWAWAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, are we all here?”</p>

<p>“Looks so—what there is of us.”</p>

<p>“And have we got everything?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t take much more.”</p>

<p>It was Jerry who asked the questions, and Ned
and Bob, in turn, who answered them. The big
automobile stood in the yard at the side of the
Hopkins homestead, stocked with the various
things the boys thought they would need on their
tour to the mountains to find Professor Snodgrass.
In addition to their own outfit, they had with
them some of the things the scientist had left
behind, when he so unexpectedly departed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the boys, the auto was an extra
large one, capable of carrying eight passengers,
and as there were but three of them they used
the extra space to pack away their belongings.</p>

<p>In addition to extra clothing, and some provisions
(you can easily imagine who oversaw to the
packing of them), the boys took a small but complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
camping outfit. There was a sleeping tent,
a portable stove and other things, for they had
decided to take their meals in the open when it
was not convenient to go to a hotel over night.</p>

<p>It was possible, also, to sleep in the auto, in
case too severe a storm made the tent undesirable.
The heavy canopy of the big car would prove
most effectual against rain.</p>

<p>The motor boys planned to make part of the
trip in the auto, and part in the boat. The latter,
they hoped, would be waiting for them on Silver
River when they arrived.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have more fun aboard her than
in the auto,” said Ned. “There’s more room to
spread yourself, and the traveling is easier.”</p>

<p>“We can sleep aboard very comfortably,”
added Jerry.</p>

<p>“And it’s a good deal easier to cook,” remarked
Bob, innocently enough, whereat his
chums burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you don’t need to eat if you don’t
want to, Ned!” spluttered the stout lad, for his
tormentor was poking him in the ribs, under pretense
of seeing how much fatter he had grown.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him worry you, Chunky,” consoled
Jerry. “He’ll be glad enough to sit up at the
table when the gong rings. Now then, help me
get this trunk up on the rear,” for a trunk, containing
some of the things they would not need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for a time, was to be put on the luggage carrier
of the auto.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, take care of yourselves,” cautioned
Mrs. Hopkins, as Jerry took his place at
the wheel. The tall lad generally did the steering
for his chums.</p>

<p>“We’ll try to,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“And, Jerry,” his mother went on, coming
down the path to kiss him good-bye, “don’t be
too harsh with the professor, even if you find he
is against you.”</p>

<p>“All right, Momsey, I’ll try,” was his answer,
after a moment of thought.</p>

<p>“And it may be all a mistake,” she added.
“I’m sure I hope it will prove to be so.”</p>

<p>“I do, too,” added the tall lad. “All ready,
fellows?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Ned, stowing away the
last of his belongings.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” called Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll go past you fellows’ houses so you can
say good-bye,” Jerry announced, as he turned the
lever of the self-starter and the big car moved
slowly forward.</p>

<p>In turn, as they glided past their homes, Ned
and Bob waved farewells to their folks, and then,
reaching the broad highway that extended over
the first part of their tour, Jerry opened the gasoline
throttle a bit wider. With a hum and a roar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the powerful engine took up the burden, bearing
the boys toward the mountains.</p>

<p>There had been busy times since they had come
back from their fruitless trip to see Professor
Snodgrass. The preparations for the trip occupied
some time, and one day was spent in going
to the swamp where the taking out of the yellow
clay was in progress.</p>

<p>Jerry did not wish to get into a conflict—verbal
or otherwise—with Fussel and his workmen, nor
with Noddy Nixon, who, it appeared, was still
acting as assistant foreman. So the motor boys
did not approach very closely the scene of operations.</p>

<p>They could see, however, that a larger force
of men was employed, and that considerable of
the yellow clay was being taken out. It was being
piled on narrow, flat-bottomed boats, that had
been made purposely to float along the little canals
created when the clay was cut out.</p>

<p>“They’re working on a big scale,” remarked
Ned, as he stood beside Jerry in the motor boat,
watching the operations.</p>

<p>“Yes, and most of their work is being done on
the land my mother used to own,” replied the tall
lad. “Well, maybe we’ll be able to get our
rights; but it looks doubtful.”</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon had strolled down to the fence
that marked the limits of the ownership of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Universal Plaster Company. But he had no excuse
for ordering away our friends, for which he
was doubtless sorry. Jerry, however, took care
not to give him any chance to be insulting, if nothing
worse.</p>

<p>Then had come the packing up and the start.</p>

<p>On and on sped the auto, the boys talking of
many matters, and speculating as to what Professor
Snodgrass would say when he saw them.</p>

<p>“Here, you take the wheel a while, Ned, I’m
tired,” requested Jerry, after about an hour in
the front seat. The car was stopped while the
transfer was being made, and when they were
about ready to proceed again Bob called:</p>

<p>“Hey! Wait a minute. I see some apples
over in that field. Wait ’till I get some.”</p>

<p>“Eating again!” cried Jerry, with a gesture of
mock despair, for Bob had been nibbling at something
ever since they started.</p>

<p>Without waiting for assent the stout lad slipped
over the fence and he had his hands and pockets
full of the apples before his chums had ceased
laughing long enough to object.</p>

<p>“They look dandy!” exulted Bob, as he
climbed back over the rails. “Have some, fellows;
I guess I’m some little Willie when it comes
to gathering apples; eh?”</p>

<p>“I guess you are, son, but it’ll cost ye suthin’!”
and to Bob’s astonishment a tall, lanky farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
arose from where he had been concealed in the
tall grass near the fence, and laid a detaining
hand on the stout lad’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hey? What’s the matter? Let me go!”
spluttered Bob, so surprised that he dropped part
of the fruit. Jerry and Ned, in the car, were
laughing at his plight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll let ye go all right,” said the farmer,
with a grin, “but you’ve got to settle fust! I find
this is the best way to collect,” he went on.
“Wait until they have the goods and then nab
’em. There ain’t no way gittin’ away from that
there!”</p>

<p>Truly it seemed so.</p>

<p>“How—how much do you want?” faltered
Bob. He was caught red-handed. He could not
deny it. And the apple tree had seemed so isolated—so
far from any house.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, son, them apples’ll cost ye about a
dollar,” said the farmer grimly. “Them’s my
best Gravensteins, and right choice they be. Yep,
I guess about a dollar’ll square matters.”</p>

<p>“A dollar!” cried Bob. “Why, I haven’t got
more’n a quart of your old apples. A dollar a
quart! Why, that’s thirty-two dollars a bushel!”</p>

<p>“Yep. Apples is kinder high this year,” went
on the man, and, whether it was intentional or
not, he reached down and brought into view an
old shotgun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is robbery!” protested Bob.</p>

<p>“Are you speakin’ of what you did?” inquired
the farmer, with a twinkle in his blue eyes. “If
ye are I agree with ye!”</p>

<p>“A dollar!” spluttered Bob. “I’ll never pay
it.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, mebby ye’d ruther come along up to
Squire Teeter’s, an’ have him value them apples,”
said the farmer coolly.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s your dollar!” cried Bob, handing
over a crumpled bill. “But it’s robbery.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” admitted the farmer coolly, as he pocketed
the money. “That’s what the folks around
here calls takin’ other people’s things—robbery.”</p>

<p>He sank down in the grass again, probably to
wait for his next victim, while Bob, under the
laughing eyes of Jerry and Ned, made his way
to the auto. They started off, and Bob’s good
nature came back as he viewed the apples.</p>

<p>“Well, they look fine, anyhow,” he said.</p>

<p>He set his teeth into one—after an effort—and
then he let out a yell.</p>

<p>“Whew! Ouch! Good night!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“They’re as hard as rocks, and as sour as
lemons!” cried Bob. “I’m stung, all right!
Those apples won’t be ripe until next winter. The
old skinflint! A dollar a quart! Whew!” and
Bob threw the apples into the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>They stopped for lunch beneath a big shady
maple tree, near a cool spring bubbling out of a
roadside hill.</p>

<p>“Bring that box under the back seat when you
come,” called Ned to Bob, who was handing out
the eatables.</p>

<p>“What box?” demanded the stout youth.</p>

<p>“The one marked ‘cakes.’ I put in a tin of
fancy ones.”</p>

<p>“Good,” cried Bob, who had a sweet tooth.</p>

<p>He reached under the seat, where Ned had told
him, but a look of surprise spread over Bob’s face,
as he brought out an empty tin.</p>

<p>“They’re gone!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s gone?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The cakes!”</p>

<p>“They are? Then somebody’s eaten ’em! I’ll
have a look!”</p>

<p>Ned ran toward the car, but, before he reached
it, there was a movement under the seat. The
leather flap was lifted up and a voice said, mildly
enough:</p>

<p>“I ate the cake, fellows. I was hungry.”</p>

<p>“Andy Rush!” cried Jerry, as he saw the
disheveled figure of the small chap. “How in
the world did you get there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I stowed away,” replied Andy, as he
crawled out. “Can’t I come along, fellows? I’ll

<small>A HARD FALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry Hopkins hardly knew whether or not
to be angry at the small lad who had the assurance
to stow himself away in the auto. Bob looked
at his tall chum as if to shape his own conduct by
Jerry’s. Ned was frankly angry.</p>

<p>“Well, you have got nerve, Andy Rush!” exclaimed
Ned. “What do you mean by slipping
in on us this way; eh? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I—er—I, well, I just couldn’t help it,” burst
out Andy, who seemed to be in some difficulty as
to what to say. “I wanted to come awfully bad,
and I was afraid you fellows wouldn’t let me if
I asked you.”</p>

<p>“That’s the time you spoke the truth!” muttered
Ned. “You sure are right—we wouldn’t
have let you.”</p>

<p>“And I thought maybe, if I came along anyhow,
and you didn’t find me until you had a good
start, you’d let me stay rather than take me home,”
finished Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take you home!” cried Ned. “Well, you
sure have got nerve! Take you home? Well,
you’ll go home the best way you can. We’re not
going to turn around and take you back to your
mother; you can make up your mind to that!”</p>

<p>“You—you won’t leave me here; will you?”
faltered Andy, looking around apprehensively, for
they were in a rather lonely neighborhood.</p>

<p>“It’s as good a place as any,” grumbled Ned.
“Stowaways can’t be choosers.”</p>

<p>Andy looked more frightened than ever. He
was only a small chap, and not very robust. His
usual vivacious manner, and his rapid style of
talking seemed to have deserted him.</p>

<p>“Go on home!” exclaimed Ned. “We don’t
want you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be mean,” urged Bob in a low tone
to his chum.</p>

<p>“No, we can’t desert him this way, even if he
did sneak in on us,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>Andy took heart from this.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t mean to do wrong,” he said eagerly.
“I’m willing to pay my way. I’ve got
’most five dollars saved up. You can have that!”
and he pulled some change from his pocket.
“Don’t send me back!” he pleaded. “Let me
come along.”</p>

<p>A flicker of a smile lighted Ned’s face. I fancy
those of you who know the merchant’s son realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that this harsh attitude was only assumed for the
time being. Really Ned was very gentle, and he
only spoke that way on the impulse of the moment,
and to make Andy feel a proper sorrow for his
escapade.</p>

<p>“You will let me stay; won’t you?” the small
boy pleaded. “I—I’ll do anything you say. I’ll
help a lot—run all your errands for you—I’ll get
water for the auto—I’ll pump up the tires—I—I’ll
put up the tent, chop wood—whoop! I’ll do
<em>everything</em>!” And Andy fairly yelled—a return
of his usual spirits.</p>

<p>“All right, if you want to work your passage,”
agreed Ned, as though a problem were solved.
“I’ve no objections, if you’re willing to help out,”
and he winked at his chums. “But it won’t be
easy,” he warned Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not looking for anything easy,” replied
Andy quickly. “I’ll do anything you tell
me to.”</p>

<p>“All right, then get some wood and make a
fire,” ordered Ned. “We want to boil some coffee.
Then hand me another of the boxes of the
cakes I put away. If it hadn’t been for them we
wouldn’t have known where you were. After that
you can hunt up a spring and get a pail of water.
I guess the auto radiator needs filling; doesn’t it,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, be a bit easy with him,” pleaded fat Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
who knew what it was to keep pace with Ned’s
demands.</p>

<p>“Keep still! It’ll do him good to hustle,”
warned Ned to Chunky, as Andy set off on his
first errand, that of getting wood.</p>

<p>“But we don’t need a fire,” objected Jerry.
“The coffee is hot in the vacuum bottle.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” laughed Ned, “but Andy ought
to do something to work his passage, and that’s
the only thing I can think of now. Let him make
a fire. And we really ought to put some water in
the radiator. Let him go.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the tall lad. “Of course
Andy had no right to stow himself away, and he
ought to have it rubbed in on him a little. But
don’t be too rough with him, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” was the promise, but Ned winked at
Bob.</p>

<p>If Andy thought he was to have a sinecure on
his stolen jaunt with the boys he was sadly mistaken.
Ned particularly seemed to “have it in
for him” and invented new tasks constantly.</p>

<p>Some of them were errands that really needed
to be done, and, to the credit of Andy be it said,
he did not once grumble. He might have suspected
he was being “worked,” when he was made
to wash the few dishes from lunch through two
waters, a hasty rinse being all that the boys usually
indulged in. But Andy was “game” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
dishes fairly shone when he restored them to the
hamper.</p>

<p>But when, as they were traveling slowly along,
looking for a good place to camp for the night,
Ned looked over, saw one of the tires flat, and
ordered Andy to get ready to pump it up, Jerry
objected.</p>

<p>“You know he can’t pump it up—he isn’t strong
enough,” the tall lad said. “Besides, we have
an air pump on the motor.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I just want to see what Andy will
say.”</p>

<p>Again the small lad was “game.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the pump?” he asked cheerfully,
as the auto stopped. “I’ll have it full of air in
a jiffy,” and he seemed ready for the back-breaking
work.</p>

<p>“You’re all right!” declared Jerry, with a
laugh. “I guess you can belong, Andy. Never
mind the hand pump. I’ll soon have the tire
fixed. We’ll have to put in a new inner tube,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>And, while this was being done Andy explained
how, after hearing of the boys’ contemplated trip,
he had made up his mind to go with them. He
knew his request would, most likely, be refused,
so, watching his chance, and being small, he managed
to slip under the seat, back of a pile of
luggage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t have come out when I did,
only I was hungry,” he finished. “I took the
cakes because I couldn’t find anything else.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you’re here you might as well
stay,” spoke Jerry. “We’ll have to send some
word to your folks, though.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t bother,” said Andy coolly. “I
told ’em I was coming with you, and they said
it would be all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have your nerve with you, if nothing
else!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ve got my baggage, too!” cried
the small lad, as he reached into the cavity where
he had made a place for himself and pulled out
a small bundle. “I brought some clothes along,”
he said.</p>

<p>This took place shortly after Andy’s discovery.
Then he had been fed, the trip was resumed, and
the puncture discovered. The repaired tire was
soon pumped up from the motor, and, after going
on a short distance farther a good camping site,
near a spring of clear, cold water, was reached.</p>

<p>“We’ll put up the sleeping tent, and use that,”
decided Jerry as, with Andy along, there would
scarcely have been room in the car.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have a camp fire,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Andy will get the wood,” broke in Ned, with
a wink at his chums.</p>

<p>“Sure!” assented the small lad, and, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
later they were eating bacon and eggs, with fragrant
coffee, around a merry blaze.</p>

<p>There was no need for haste on the trip, and
the boys did not speed their auto. They felt that
Professor Snodgrass, even if he were successful
in finding the two-tailed lizard, would not return
to his home at once. He would, most likely, remain
in the mountains in search of other specimens.
So the boys took their time. They planned
to be two days on the road in the auto, and about
as much longer in the boat, though this time
could be cut down considerably if there were need
for it.</p>

<p>They camped, on the evening of their third
day’s auto trip, at the foot of a steep hill, the
road having been cut through it, and high banks
rising on either side. So far, aside from tire
troubles, and once getting stuck in a bog, when
they tried a short cut, the journey had not been
eventful.</p>

<p>Supper was gotten at a road-side blaze, and
the boys were stretched out in lazy comfort on
the grass when Bob, who usually showed little
desire for unnecessary exercise, scrambled to his
feet.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Jerry, looking at his fat
chum.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw some sort of a lizard in a
hole up on the face of that hill,” responded Bob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
“Maybe it’s the two-tailed one the professor
wants. If it isn’t it may be some kind of a rare
specimen. I’ll see if I can get it for him,” and
with that Bob started up the incline.</p>

<p>“Come back—you’ll fall,” cried Ned, for the
climb was not an easy one.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can make it,” was the answer. “It’s
some sort of a lizard sure enough, but not a two-tailed
one,” and Bob pointed to where a wriggling
object could be seen. His chums sat up
watching him, but they were not prepared for
what followed.</p>

<p>Bob reached for a shrub, growing on the side
of the hill, intending to pull himself up by it.
But, as he grasped it, the shrub pulled loose, and,
an instant afterward, the stout lad toppled backward,
turning completely over, and rolled to the
bottom of the hill. The others could hear his
head come in contact with a stone, and then poor
Bob rolled into a crumpled heap, and lay motionless.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry, Ned and Andy were on their feet together
and in an instant. Together, also, they
started for the place where poor Bob lay.</p>

<p>“That was a nasty fall,” declared Ned as
he raced onward.</p>

<p>“A hard one,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is he dead, do you think?” Andy asked.
“Maybe his neck is broken—what’ll we do?
Have to get a doctor—I’ll go—in the auto—poor
Bob! I wonder if he got the lizard?”</p>

<p>“Dry—up!” ordered Ned, pausing between
the two words, and the volatile Andy subsided.</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry leaned over their friend. He
was unconscious, and, as Jerry lifted him, a trickle
of blood ran from the back of his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, his skull is fractured!” cried Andy, who
shuddered at the sight of the bright, crimson
stream that spread over Jerry’s hand.</p>

<p>“Andy, if you don’t cut out that kind of talk
I’ll boot you one!” cried Ned, in exasperation.
“Now you go get some water and something
for a bandage. Take one of my shirts if you
can’t find anything else. Hustle now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the best advice to give Andy. He
needed something to do to take his mind off the
accident.</p>

<p>“Is he hurt badly, do you think?” asked Ned,
as he helped Jerry carry Bob to a grassy place.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell. I’ll have a look when I
wash off his head. There’s a bad cut, that’s evident.”</p>

<p>They laid the stout lad, now sadly limp and
white, on a soft place in the grass. By this time
Andy had come up with the water, and some
pieces of cloth, obtained by hastily tearing up the
only extra shirt he had brought along for himself.</p>

<p>Jerry soaked a rag in water, and carefully
sponged away the blood; but, as he did so, more
spurted out from a long gash on the scalp.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better let it alone until it coagulates,
or at least until a doctor can look at it,”
he said. “It will need sewing up, if I’m any
judge, and we’ll have to get help for that.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums knew something of rough
and ready first aid to the injured, but this was
beyond their skill.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” asked Ned, rather helplessly.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get a doctor,” said Jerry.
“Let’s see, the last town we passed through was
Lynnhaven. It didn’t look as though it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
support a physician of any account, and the nearest
doctor must live a good ways out.”</p>

<p>“There’s quite a town just ahead of us,” suggested
Ned. “I noticed the last signboard we
passed said it was eleven miles to it. There ought
to be a doctor there, and we could bring him to
Bob in the auto.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do!” cried Jerry. “You
and Andy will have to stay with Bob, Ned, while
I go for help. You can put up the tent, and get
him under that, while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>“Shall we give him any medicine?” asked
Ned, for they had brought a few simple things
with them, as they always did.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t give him anything but water,”
replied the tall lad. “He’ll probably develop a
fever, and the simpler the things he has, the better
for him, until the doctor sees him.</p>

<p>“Come on, Andy!” called Jerry to the small
lad. “You’ve carried water enough. Now you
help Ned put up the tent, and make Bob as comfortable
as you can. I’m off.”</p>

<p>Jerry lost no time. Taking out of the auto
the tent, and other things he thought would be
needed, he took his place at the wheel, shoved
over the lever of the self-starter, and was off in
a cloud of dust. For Jerry had determined not
to observe any speed laws, save as they concerned
his own safety. He realized that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
errand would be excuse enough if he were
stopped, and he did not think he would be, as it
was getting dusk.</p>

<p>“I ought to do the eleven miles in short order,”
reflected Jerry, as the car swung around a
turn, almost skidding. “The only trouble will
be to find a doctor at home.”</p>

<p>But it was not to be all smooth sailing for
Jerry. He had not covered more than five of the
eleven miles when the sky became overcast, and a
little later he was in the midst of a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>He did not mind this, however, as the canopy
was up, and the rain-shield protected him. Jerry
switched on the electric lights, and kept on,
though he reduced his speed somewhat. He had
to stop once to get out at a cross-road and read
the signs, and then, as luck would have it, he
took the wrong turn. It was not his fault, as the
old sign post leaned so that it was difficult for
a stranger to determine in which direction the
hand pointed.</p>

<p>“Am I on the road to Brookville?” Jerry
yelled at a passing farmer, who sat huddled up
in a horse blanket on the seat of his rickety
wagon.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Hey?” asked the man, one remark
being addressed to his horse, and the question to
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, am I on the road to Brookville?”</p>

<p>“No, you’re headed for Deanhurst. You
ought to have took the left hand road a piece
back to get to Brookville. Can’t you read the
signs?”</p>

<p>“I can, yes—when they’re right,” snapped
Jerry, who was not in the best of humor.
“Thanks!” he called, as he waited for the other
to pass on, so that he might turn the car. It
was no easy matter to get the big machine headed
the other way in the narrow road, but Jerry
finally managed it and then he sent the auto on at
a fast clip, passing the man who had given him
the needed direction.</p>

<p>Jerry reached the decrepit sign post again,
and this time made the right turn. It grew
darker and darker as he advanced, but the lights
on the car were powerful. The thunder and lightning
had ceased, but it still rained hard, and the
roads were fast becoming puddles of mud and
water.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I have the car,” reflected Jerry.
“A doctor won’t have the excuse that he doesn’t
want to take his horse out in the storm.”</p>

<p>It was fully night when Jerry reached Brookville,
though had it not been for the storm there
would have been the glow of sunset to dispel the
gloom. The tall lad stopped at the first house he
came to, in order to inquire about a doctor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was delighted to learn that a physician lived
about a mile down the road.</p>

<p>But his delight was turned to disappointment
when he reached the office, and learned that the
medical man had been called out into the country,
on a case that would probably keep him all night.</p>

<p>“But he’s needed for an accident!” cried
Jerry. “Is there any other physician in town?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he was informed. “Dr. Madison lives
about two miles out, on the State road.”</p>

<p>But Dr. Madison was not at home either, and
his wife could not say when he would return.</p>

<p>“Sometimes he is out until long after midnight,”
she said. “His patients are widely scattered.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” muttered Jerry, speaking
more to himself than to the doctor’s wife. He
thought of poor Bob in the little tent, with Andy
and Ned keeping lonely vigil beside him.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said the lady, when Jerry
had told of the circumstances, and the need of
haste. “I heard there is a New York doctor
stopping at the hotel in the village. He came
up here for a rest, but perhaps he might go see
your friend. I don’t know who the doctor is,
but I have heard my husband speak highly of
him. He is some sort of a specialist, so I understand.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try him!” decided Jerry desperately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“He can’t refuse to help us out in this emergency.”</p>

<p>A little later his mud-spattered car drew up at
the only hotel in the village.</p>

<p>“Is there a physician stopping here?” asked
Jerry of the hotel clerk. The lad’s appearance
indicated the need of haste, and alarm and anxiety
showed on his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Wright is stopping here,” replied
the man behind the desk, “but I don’t know that
he would like——”</p>

<p>“May I see him?” interrupted Jerry. “It’s
a case of accident, and he’s just got to come.
Both the other doctors are out of town.”</p>

<p>As he spoke a tall, slim gentleman, in a well-fitting,
dark suit came from the dining-room to
the hotel corridor. Beside him walked a handsome
young woman. The man showed interest in
Jerry’s rather loud remarks, and at the word
“doctor” said:</p>

<p>“Is someone hurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes—my chum,” replied Jerry quickly.
“He had a bad fall and his skull may be fractured.”</p>

<p>“That is Dr. Wright,” the clerk informed
Jerry, but the lad had already guessed as much.</p>

<p>“Oh, can you come?” appealed Bob’s chum.
“We’re afraid he’s badly hurt. It was a fall!”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Dr. Wright.</p>

<p>“About eleven miles from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor involuntarily looked out at the
raging storm.</p>

<p>“I have a car!” cried Jerry eagerly. “You
won’t get a bit wet. I can have you there in
half an hour, and bring you back.”</p>

<p>The doctor smiled grimly at the lady beside
him.</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to escape from it,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered with a gentle smile. “But
perhaps you had better go, even if you are on
your vacation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he assented, somewhat wearily.
“I must go, of course, as long as there is no one
else. I’ll be with you directly, young man,” he
said to Jerry. “Just as soon as I can get on a
coat, and pack my bag.”</p>

<p>“I came out here to get rid of work,” he went
on, “but I seem to have it thrust upon me. But
never mind.”</p>

<p>Jerry fidgetted about impatiently until the physician,
wearing a heavy raincoat, and carrying a
black bag, descended from his room. Then,
eager to be in motion, Jerry led the way to the
waiting car.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine auto you have,” observed Dr.
Wright.</p>

<p>“Yes, it goes, too,” added Jerry. “I’ll soon
have you there.”</p>

<p>Neither Jerry nor the physician spoke much on
the trip. Each was too busy with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thoughts. Jerry sent the car ahead at even
greater speed than he had used coming out, for
he knew the road now. Soon, splashing through
mud and water, now sliding on some inclined
highway, and again puffing up a hill, they came
in sight of a lighted tent beside the road.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are camping here!” exclaimed the
doctor.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” Jerry explained. “We are
making a trip, and we have a sleeping tent. My
chum is in there with a friend.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have a look at him.”</p>

<p>It was raining hard when the doctor and Jerry
alighted, and the small tent was not the best
place in the world wherein to make an examination.
Andy had worked well, however, and had
made Bob as comfortable as possible. The latter
was on an improvised bed, with rubber blankets
under him, and well covered. Fortunately the
tent was waterproof.</p>

<p>The doctor bent over Bob.</p>

<p>“Has he showed any signs of consciousness
since he received the hurt?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He moaned once or twice—that’s all,” answered
Andy.</p>

<p>“Hum!” remarked the physician non-committally.
“I’m afraid I can’t do anything for
him here. He ought to be at the hotel. Do you
think you can take him there in the auto?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to,” said Jerry simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>They made an improvised stretcher, and carried
Bob through the rain to the car. He was
propped up in the tonneau, and then, the tent
being struck, Jerry, Andy and Ned, with the physician,
took their places in the car.</p>

<p>Jerry drove more slowly on the return trip,
but it was made in good time, and without accident.
Bob was still unconscious when carried
into the hotel, and taken to a room that was hastily
prepared for him. The doctor took charge
of matters now, and, somewhat to Jerry’s surprise,
the lady he had seen with the doctor appeared
in the garb of a trained nurse.</p>

<p>“You fellows are in luck,” remarked the
hotel clerk, while Ned, Andy and Jerry were
waiting in the corridor for the result of the doctor’s
examination.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Jerry. “A doctor
and a trained nurse located at the same time. Is
she the doctor’s nurse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, his head one, I believe. You know who
Dr. Wright is; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say I do,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s the greatest surgeon on brain diseases
and head injuries in the country!” exclaimed
the admiring clerk. “He’s an authority,
and so much in demand that he can charge anything
he pleases. He gets anywhere from one to
ten thousand dollars for an operation.”</p>

<small>A CRY OF FIRE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry looked sharply at Ned. The same
thought was in the minds of both—would they
have money enough to pay the doctor, in case it
should be found that Bob was badly hurt, and
needed a complicated operation?</p>

<p>Then Jerry smiled. Of course, even though
the skill of the celebrated surgeon was required,
he would not have to be paid at once. And Bob’s
father was wealthy. After all, there was no need
for worry, save as to Bob himself.</p>

<p>And this was soon dispelled, for Miss Payson,
which, the clerk said, was the name of the doctor’s
head nurse, soon came down to relieve the
anxiety of the boys.</p>

<p>“How’s Bob?” Jerry asked her impulsively.</p>

<p>“All right,” she answered with a smile. “He
has only a scalp wound.”</p>

<p>“Then his skull isn’t fractured?” asked
Andy, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, no! The doctor will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have him very comfortable, and then I’ll stay
with him to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we can’t think of letting you do
that!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” and Miss Payson elevated her
eyebrows, and smiled at the eager lad. “I fancy
you’ll have to,” she said. “Dr. Wright isn’t in
the habit of having his orders disobeyed, and he
has told me to look after the patient to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that’s too bad!” burst out Jerry.
“Just when you are on your vacation, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it doesn’t so much matter,” said
the nurse, genially. “As long as we have taken
the case we will see it through. That’s Dr.
Wright’s way.”</p>

<p>“Is it—is it serious?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all. You boys can stand harder
bumps on the head than you imagine. If concussion
doesn’t develop your friend will be up and
about in a few days.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” returned Jerry, for though
there was no special need for haste, still he
wanted to get in touch with Professor Snodgrass
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“Now I must go back,” said the nurse. “I
just came down to relieve your anxiety.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” rejoined Jerry.</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows are in luck,” the clerk informed
them when Miss Payson was gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
“You’ve got a combination, in that nurse and
doctor, that many a millionaire would be glad to
have.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” questioned Ned.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” went on the hotel
man. “Dr. Wright is a specialist whom even
European physicians are glad to consult.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as we had to have someone,
it might as well be the best,” said Jerry. “Bob’s
father can afford it, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t charge you so much, seeing
he is on his vacation,” suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“He’ll probably charge more,” declared the
clerk. “Say, he earns more by one operation
than I do in a year.”</p>

<p>“But look how long it took him to study and
qualify for the work he does,” suggested Ned.
“Is he only a specialist on injuries to the head?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he takes up most,” the clerk
informed the boys, “though of course he must
know about all kinds of doctoring.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums decided to put up at the
hotel for the night, since it could not be told how
long they would have to remain.</p>

<p>When they had been assigned to their rooms,
and had seen to the putting away of the auto in
a garage connected with the hotel, they sat in the
lobby, waiting for Miss Payson to tell them how
Bob was progressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>They soon received good news. The nurse
approached them with a smiling face, and said:</p>

<p>“He’s conscious now.”</p>

<p>“May we see him?” asked impulsive Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed! Not until morning,” was
her quick answer. “He needs rest and quiet.
He had a bad fall, but not a serious one. He
will be lame and sore for a day or two. I’ll
look after him.”</p>

<p>“Tell him we’re here, so he won’t worry,”
suggested Jerry, and the nurse promised.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, it isn’t as bad as I thought it
would be,” said Dr. Wright a little later, when
he had laid aside his sick-room habiliments, and
joined them in the lobby. “It’s only a big cut.
Let me see, I don’t believe you told me who he
is.”</p>

<p>“His name is Bob Baker,” said Jerry, “and
if you will send your bill to his father I
know——”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut!” interrupted the physician with
a laugh. “This is no time to talk about bills.
I am only too glad that I was able to serve you
in the emergency. Any doctor would be. I was
getting a bit out of practice, anyhow. I haven’t
had a patient in nearly a week,” and he laughed
genially.</p>

<p>Miss Payson remained with Bob all night,
though he needed little attention, for he slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
heavily. In the morning he was much improved;
but Dr. Wright said he must not be moved for
at least two days, or until all danger of brain
concussion was passed.</p>

<p>“Did I get that lizard?” asked the stout lad
when, in due time, he was allowed to sit up in
bed and receive his chums.</p>

<p>“We didn’t stop to look,” replied Jerry, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Bob slowly. “It might have
been just what Professor Snodgrass was looking
for. I say, how long before we’re going on
with the trip?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll soon be able to travel,” said Miss
Payson with a smile. “You boys are the most
wonderful creatures in the world. You get knocks
that would almost kill a grown person, and you
come up smiling every time. I wish I were a
boy.”</p>

<p>“I wish so, too!” exclaimed Bob with enthusiasm,
for he and his chums had taken a great
liking to the young and pretty nurse. She told
them she had been with Dr. Wright for some
time, and, when he found he needed a vacation
he insisted on taking her with him, in addition to
his sister and a man servant.</p>

<p>“I guess he must be pretty rich,” said Bob,
when he was alone with his chums. “Dad will
have a steep bill on my account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” laughed the stout lad. “Dad is
able to meet it, and I guess he thinks I’m worth
it—at least I hope so.”</p>

<p>Jerry was glad <em>his</em> mother did not have a
heavy doctor’s bill to meet, for, in the present
state of Mrs. Hopkins’s finances, it would have
embarrassed her very much.</p>

<p>“But if I can only get back that clay land
we’ll be all right,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>He had spoken casually of the new medicated
clay put out by the Universal Plaster Company,
and Dr. Wright had heard him.</p>

<p>“That certainly is wonderful stuff!” said the
celebrated physician. “I have tried it on some
of my cases. It is a wonder no one ever thought
before of using it. It works like magic. There
is a fortune in it for the promoters.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not tell the doctor that the clay came
from land which had once been owned by Mrs.
Hopkins.</p>

<p>Bob was well enough, on the third day, to be
up, and two days later permission was given to
him to travel, if too great a speed was not maintained.</p>

<p>“You must go a bit slow with him at first,”
Dr. Wright informed the boys. “He is out of
all danger, however, and I wish you good luck
on the rest of your trip. I have heard of Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Snodgrass. He is a wonderful scientist in
his line.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to remain here long?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall stay until I get thoroughly rested.
It is a quiet place, just what I need, and I don’t
imagine I shall have any more emergency calls,”
and the great doctor smiled.</p>

<p>He little realized, nor did the boys, how soon
they would have need of his services again.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the injunction of the physician
as to speed, Jerry did not try to make fast
time in the auto, once they were under way again.
They had said good-bye to Dr. Wright and his
friends at the hotel, and again were headed toward
the mountains. Two days more of leisurely
travel would bring them to Silver River, where
they expected to take to the motor boat and in
it sail up Lake Mogan to where Professor Snodgrass
was camping, and looking for the two-tailed
lizard.</p>

<p>Without further incident, or accident, they
came, one evening, to the town of Waydell, at
the head of the river. It was to this place they
had shipped the boat, and they had received, en
route, a postal from the man they had engaged to
put it in the water for them, the postal stating
that the craft had arrived safely, and would be
waiting for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s go down and have a look at her,” suggested
Jerry, after their supper at the hotel,
where they arranged to leave their auto until they
came cruising back.</p>

<p>The <i>Scud</i> was in the boathouse, taking up considerable
of the available space, for the boys’ new
craft was a large one.</p>

<p>“Does she run all right?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Fine!” said the man in charge of the boathouse.
“We had her out for a spin, and she
passed everything on the river.”</p>

<p>The boys, who had adjoining rooms in the
hotel, were awakened in the middle of the night
by a commotion in the street.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned, for Bob got up
to look from the window.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a cry of fire,” was the answer.
“It is!” exclaimed Bob, a moment later.</p>

<p>“Is it the hotel?” demanded Ned, leaping out
of bed to join his chum Jerry.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem so. They’re all running toward
the river.”</p>

<p>A moment later they heard someone in the
street ask:</p>

<p>“Where’s the blaze?”</p>

<p>“Down at Kroll’s boathouse,” was the reply.
“The whole place is going!”</p>

<p>“Kroll’s boathouse!” cried Ned. “Come on,
fellows! That’s where the <i>Scud</i> is tied up!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>ON THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>How the motor boys got into their clothes they
hardly knew at the time, and afterward there
was so much to talk about that they did not go
into those details.</p>

<p>Jerry echoed Ned’s cry with:</p>

<p>“Lively, fellows! We’ve got to get down
there in jig style, and put her out in the river!”</p>

<p>“We’re with you!” exclaimed Bob, whose recent
injury was now only in evidence in a small
bandage around his head.</p>

<p>“And be careful of yourself!” cautioned Ned.</p>

<p>Out of their rooms, the doors of which opened
one into the other, the boys rushed, half dressed.
It was no time for ceremony, and the fact that
the fire was so near the hotel had aroused most
of the guests.</p>

<p>Many of them were running about as though
the place itself were on fire, but sufficient notice
had been given to quell any possible panic. Those
going out did so for the reason that they wanted
to view the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>That the blaze was a large one was evidenced
as soon as the boys reached the street, for they
could see the reflection in the sky of the ruddy,
leaping flames.</p>

<p>“Some fire!” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” responded Jerry. “Come
on!”</p>

<p>Some of the fire apparatus of Waydell was
already at the scene, and other engines were on
the way. The place boasted of three, and it was
soon seen that all would be needed.</p>

<p>“And more, too!” panted a half-dressed man
who rushed along with the boys. “I reckon
they’d better telephone over to Lafayette, and
get what apparatus they can. It’s going to be
a hummer, all right!”</p>

<p>And, as Jerry, Ned and Bob turned a corner,
and sped down a street that led to Silver River
they saw that the blaze was in a large lumber
yard, adjoining the house where their boat was
stored. The piles of dry boards were rapidly
being licked up by the advancing flames. While
the boathouse had not yet caught it was evident
that it soon would go, for the wind was driving
the tongues of fire in its direction.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t caught yet,” panted Bob, as he
raced on beside Jerry. “False alarm for us!”</p>

<p>“Not much!” snapped the tall lad. “We’ve
got to get busy. It’ll go up in short order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what!” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>So hot was the blaze, and so fiercely was it
eating up the lumber that the firemen made no
attempt to save the board-piles that had already
caught. They were devoting their energies to
saving the surrounding property.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd already on hand, and
it was growing larger every minute. The boys
managed to push their way through, after some
hard work, gaining a place where they could see
the fire more plainly. And as they gained a
vantage point they saw that which made them
cry out in alarm.</p>

<p>For the side of the boathouse, nearest the
lumber yard, which side had been smoking from
the heat, now burst into flame.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” supplemented Bob.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows! That’s our cue!” yelled
Jerry. “We’ve got to get our boat out!”</p>

<p>The crowd, surprised by the sudden turn of
the fire, gave way for a moment, and this presented
to the boys just the advantage they wanted.
There was an opening through which they slipped,
running on toward the blazing boat house.</p>

<p>“Hey! Come back here!” called one of the
firemen, for fire lines had been stretched.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind him!” advised Jerry. “We
know what we’re about!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>And he and his chums ran on, unheeding.</p>

<p>As they reached the doors on the shore side
of the structure another fireman, hurrying up
with an axe called to them:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here? Get back!
You’re not allowed here!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to get out our boat,” said
Jerry sharply. “It won’t take a minute to run
it out of the boathouse now, and we don’t want
to stand by and see it burn.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” the fireman agreed. “I’ll
help you. No use standing on ceremony.”</p>

<p>He gave a glance at the doors. They were
locked and there was no time to look for the
key.</p>

<p>“Stand aside!” the fighter of the flames
called. The boys drew back, and, with a few
blows of his axe, the man shattered the fastening
of the door.</p>

<p>“There you go!” he cried, as Jerry, Ned and
Bob rushed into the structure. The flames without,
shining in through the shattered door, made
it light enough to see. Their boat, as yet, was
unharmed, but already the flames were eating
through the thin side of the boathouse which
had first caught.</p>

<p>“Lively, boys!” yelled Jerry. “You and
Bob cast off the mooring ropes, Ned, and I’ll
start the motor. Lucky she’s in shape to run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to open those other doors,
Jerry!” Ned cried, pointing to those which were
on the river side. They were big, double ones,
swinging on hinges instead of raising up like a
window sash.</p>

<p>“We’ll ram ’em!” Jerry shouted. “We
haven’t time to try the axe on ’em!”</p>

<p>In fact, there was no axe to use, for the fireman,
as soon as he had smashed open the shore
doors for the boys, had set off to join his comrades.</p>

<p>The <i>Scud</i> lay in the basin of the boathouse
with her bow pointed outward, for she had been
backed in after her final trial the evening before.
And the basin was sufficiently long to enable her
to get headway enough to gain considerable
power.</p>

<p>“All ready?” cried Jerry to his chums, as he
bent over the motor.</p>

<p>“All ready,” answered Ned. “Let her go.”</p>

<p>Jerry thrust over the switch of the self-starter.
There was a whine of the generator, and then
came the hum and throb as the motor itself
started.</p>

<p>“Here we go, boys! Be ready to duck!”
Jerry yelled, as he pulled on the gear handle, and
the motor meshed in the cogs of the propeller
shaft. There was a boiling and bubbling under
the stern, and the powerful craft surged forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Down in front!” Jerry cried, for Ned and
Bob were standing in the bow as unconcernedly
as though they were on a pleasure jaunt, whereas,
in another moment, the boat would ram the
locked doors.</p>

<p>The fire had now eaten a large hole in the side
of the boathouse, so that the interior was well
lighted. The boys could hear the crackle of
flames, and the shouts of men mingled with the
puffing of the steamers. The whistle of boats
approaching to do battle with the flames from
the river front, was also heard.</p>

<p>“Low bridge!” cried Jerry, as the bow of
the <i>Scud</i> rammed the double doors. There was
a crash, and a splintering of wood, but the portals
held, and did not swing open. The shock
sent the boat back in the water, and the boys
were almost thrown off their feet.</p>

<p>“Got to try again!” Jerry cried. He had
put the propeller out of gear as soon as the
boat hit, and now he reversed the screw. The
<i>Scud</i> drew back to the limit of the water in the
boathouse.</p>

<p>Once more she came rushing at the double
doors. It must be now or never, for by this
time the interior of the structure was beginning
to blaze.</p>

<p>“Crash!” went the bow, aimed full at the
dividing line between the doors. And this time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
weakened as they were by the previous assault,
they gave way. <a href="#image02">The <i>Scud</i> shot out into the
stream.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_164">THE SCUD SHOT OUT INTO THE STREAM.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Bob. “We’ve saved her!”</p>

<p>“But it was a close call,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And those other boats in there are goners,”
remarked Ned. “Too bad!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can save one or two,” suggested
Jerry, for there were a number of fine motor
craft in the place.</p>

<p>It was rather dangerous turning back, for the
house was now half enveloped in flames. But
the <i>Scud</i> was under control, and the boys well
knew how to handle her. Accordingly her bow
was pushed back into the boathouse long enough
for the boys to cast off the mooring lines of two
other boats, which they shoved out into the river.</p>

<p>“Better pull out! It’s getting too hot here,”
panted Ned.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” agreed Jerry. He sent
their boat out into the middle of the stream, and
the cool night air was grateful to the boys.</p>

<p>From this vantage point they watched the
progress of the flames. The fire would have to
be left to burn itself out, for, after the lumber
yard and the boathouse were consumed, there
was no other material near for the flames to feed
on. The firemen could do but little, as the conflagration
was beyond control when discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time after midnight the fire had nearly
burned itself out, and the boys, finding another
boathouse, where they could leave their craft,
went back to the hotel. They found Andy Rush
there waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Where have you fellows been? I was looking
all over for you! Big fire!” panted Andy.</p>

<p>“We’ve been saving the boat,” said Jerry
coolly. “What happened to you?”</p>

<p>And then it developed that they had forgotten
all about Andy in the excitement. His room was
farther down the corridor, and they had not remembered
to call him.</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed Andy, when explanations
were made. “You might have called me!”</p>

<p>“There was excitement enough without you,”
spoke Ned drily.</p>

<p>There was little more sleep for our friends
that night, though they dozed fitfully. A careful
examination in the morning showed no damage
to the <i>Scud</i>, beyond a little paint scratched
from her bow.</p>

<p>“That won’t delay us,” decided Jerry. Their
baggage and stores were put aboard, a goodly
supply of provisions was laid in, and, steaming
up past the burned lumber yard, our friends were
soon on their way by boat to locate Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

</div>


<p>“Well, this is something like living!”</p>

<p>“It sure is! The weather man is good to us!”</p>

<p>“This beats the auto!”</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned, Bob and Andy were taking their
ease in the <i>Scud</i>, which was making her way
down Silver River toward Lake Mogan, which
lay fifty miles to the south. I say taking their
ease, for they were not trying to make speed,
but going along at a comfortable rate. They
planned to spend two days on the river, and
about three days more on the lake, though by
urging their motor to higher power they could
very much shorten this time. But, even though
Jerry was anxious to have a consultation with
Professor Snodgrass, he did not feel the need of
great haste.</p>

<p>“Well, the auto’s all right when you want it,”
commented Jerry, in answer to Bob’s last remark.
“It came in very handy the night you
were hurt.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob, touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
place on his head where Dr. Wright had taken
the stitches.</p>

<p>“I like an auto!” exclaimed Andy. “It goes
so much faster—zip! Away you go! Up hill
and down! Never stop! Faster and faster!
Get a puncture! Fix her up! Away you go!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and away you’ll go, if you’re not careful!”
cried Ned, for the small chap, in his excitement,
nearly slipped overboard. He occupied
a rather perilous position on the bow, and
Ned pulled him into the enclosed cabin.</p>

<p>“Andy likes an auto because it’s easier to hide
in,” remarked Bob, with a smile at the stowaway.
“And, by the way, Andy, you promised to work
your passage, you know. You might holystone
the deck for practice.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” asked Andy of Jerry. The boy
was really in earnest in his desire to do whatever
tasks were required of him, and he had been a
jolly companion since he had been allowed to
make the journey.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not this morning,” was Jerry’s
answer. “The decks will do very well.”</p>

<p>“Then you can help me get dinner,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Dinner!” cried Ned. “Why, we just had
breakfast!”</p>

<p>“Huh! That was an hour ago!” declared
Bob. “You’ve got to plan dinner ahead, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
guess. If I’m going to be cook I want to know
what I’ve got to get ready.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and be cook,” granted Ned.
“Nobody wants your job, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” volunteered Andy, and the two
were soon busy calculating what sort of a meal
to serve. It would be the first one aboard the
boat that trip.</p>

<p>Their craft had been stored, for the remainder
of the night following the fire, at a house farther
up the river than the destroyed lumber yard.
And now, as they steamed past it, they saw men
at work, trying to see if anything had been saved
from the flames. Some of the piles were still
smouldering, and on these the firemen were playing
streams of water.</p>

<p>“That was a lucky escape for us,” Jerry reminded
his chums.</p>

<p>“It sure was,” they agreed.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, their boat was running
to perfection, there was plenty to eat aboard,
and the boys could enjoy their vacation to the
full. The only matter that worried Jerry was
the financial status of his mother. And that
could not be helped—at least just at present.</p>

<p>“But if we can get back that swamp land, and
work the yellow clay deposits ourselves,” mused
the tall lad, “it will make a big difference. I
can’t understand Professor Snodgrass. It doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
seem possible that he would go back on us that
way, and yet he did. But, as mother says, I’ll
give him a ‘show for his white alley.’”</p>

<p>They had decided to do no night traveling, as
they were on uncertain waters, and there was no
special need for haste. So, as the afternoon
waned they began looking for a good river town
where they could tie up for the night. They
passed through one called Birchville about five
o’clock, and learning there was a good restaurant
not far from the river they decided to get supper
there, rather than cook aboard the <i>Scud</i> again.
They would, however, sleep in the cabin bunks,
as there were a number of comfortable beds arranged.</p>

<p>“And I think I’ll just stop at the post-office
and send mother back a card,” Jerry decided.
“We’ll probably get some mail from home, at
Mason Junction, which we’ll reach in the morning.”</p>

<p>The boys had asked their folks to write to them
at this place, and there was a letter for each one
of them except Andy when they arrived about
ten o’clock the next morning. Andy, coming
away in such a hurry, and in such a surreptitious
manner, had not been able to give any mail directions.</p>

<p>“But your folks are all right,” said Bob, reading
his own letter. “My mother says your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
mother called on her the other day, Andy, and
they spoke of you.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said the small chap. “As long
as they’re all right I won’t worry.”</p>

<p>“I never knew him to worry anyhow,” observed
Jerry, who was deep in his own correspondence.
There was not much news from
Cresville. Mrs. Hopkins wrote that the men
were still taking out large quantities of clay from
the swamp.</p>

<p>“But, whatever you do, Jerry,” she penned,
“don’t run into trouble on account of the swamp
land. It isn’t worth it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to give it up without a
struggle,” Jerry declared. “If the professor
comes over to our side after all we may be able
to beat those fellows yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be on Lake Mogan to-morrow
morning,” announced the tall lad as they tied
up, the second night on the river. “We’re at
Ralston now, and an hour’s travel after breakfast
will bring us to the lake.”</p>

<p>“Is it much of a lake?” Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair size. We won’t see much of it
this trip, if we head for the professor’s camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ve seen plenty of lakes,” remarked
Ned. “We had quite a time on Lost
Lake, you remember.”</p>

<p>“We sure did—with that old hermit,” assented
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The second night aboard the boat passed off
quietly enough, though about midnight Andy
roused and excitedly whispered:</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Huh! What’s matter?” sleepily asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I—I hear something,” murmured Andy.</p>

<p>“Ned snoring, I guess,” answered Bob, turning
over to resume his nap.</p>

<p>“No, it’s somebody trying to get aboard the
boat!” insisted Andy.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jerry, suddenly sitting
up in his bunk.</p>

<p>“Andy had the nightmare and thought a horse
was coming aboard, I guess,” chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>“I did not!” indignantly denied Andy. “But
I heard something, all right.”</p>

<p>And, unmistakably there did come, just then,
a bumping sound at one side of the craft.</p>

<p>“Keep still,” advised Jerry in a whisper, as
he cautiously slipped from his bunk. He went
outside, and, a moment later there was a blinding
flash, as Jerry switched on the searchlight. Then
the tall lad laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a big muskrat. He was swimming
alongside. I guess we must have tied up
in front of his nest. Well, we won’t bother you,
old fellow,” and Jerry came back to bed.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went on again, and, in
about an hour’s time they saw, shining before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
them, at the mouth of the river, the sparkling
waters of Lake Mogan.</p>

<p>“There she is!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“The last half of our trip!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“And Professor Snodgrass is at the end of
this lake—or, at least I hope he is,” said Jerry,
looking ahead as he stood at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Speed her up!” cried Andy, who liked swift
motion.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Jerry, as he opened
wider the gasoline throttle. The <i>Scud</i> shot ahead
for a few feet and then the boys were almost
thrown from their feet as the craft struck some
obstruction under water.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Ned, as Jerry quickly
shut off the power.</p>

<p>“Back water!” called Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry had thrown in the reverse gear, but it
was too late. The <i>Scud</i> was as if anchored at
the junction of lake and river. The obstruction
which she had struck held her fast.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>THE DESERTED CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Guess we ought to have had a chart of this
lake,” observed Jerry grimly, as he looked over
the side of the boat.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” came from Ned. “What is
it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Hard to say,” replied Jerry. “We either
struck a log, a rock or a sand bank. Guess we’ll
have to take a look to tell what it is. We’re
fast, at any rate.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of that. The <i>Scud</i> lay
motionless on the water, tilted slightly. On
either rail stretched a wide expanse of low,
marshy ground, in which cat-tails and rushes
seemed to thrive. There was no town or settlement
near, and only a few scattered boat houses,
about which there seemed to be no life. It was
a rather lonely neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Are we taking in any water?” asked Ned,
looking at the bottom of the cabin floor.</p>

<p>“Not enough to show yet, anyhow,” replied
Jerry, for the floor of the cabin was raised some
distance above the bottom of the boat, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
carpeted. “We can soon tell, though. Sound
the pump, Bob.”</p>

<p>There was a hand pump that went down into
the bilge of the boat, and, by means of this, water
could be pumped out when the motor was not
running. In case of a bad leak, by the turning of
a valve the motor itself would force out any water
that came in.</p>

<p>“She seems to have more in than usual,” announced
Bob, as he managed to get a fairly good
stream from the hand pump nozzle.</p>

<p>“Seams opened a bit, I guess,” was Jerry’s
opinion. “We didn’t appear to strike hard
enough to put a hole in her. Well, let’s see
what’s to be done. In the first place, let’s find
out how bad a leak it is.”</p>

<p>The boards of the cabin floor could be taken
up, and when this was done, not without some
labor, no hole could be seen. But the water was
undoubtedly coming in faster than it did ordinarily
when it seeped in through the stuffing box,
or through opened cracks.</p>

<p>“Not so much but what we can keep it down
by the motor pump,” remarked Jerry. “Now
let’s see if we can pull her off by her own power.”</p>

<p>He started the motor, and with the screw reversed
put on full speed. But, though the water
foamed and bubbled at the stern, the boat remained
immovable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“No go,” declared Jerry. He tried again
and again, but without result.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s got to go overboard,” he announced.</p>

<p>“You mean to lighten ship?” asked Andy,
and he seemed a bit apprehensive.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered the tall lad, with a
smile. “I mean someone will have to dive over
and see what sort of a thing we’re stuck on.
Then we can tell what to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” volunteered Ned, who was perhaps
the best swimmer of the boys. “I wonder if it’s
cold?” and he thrust his hand over the gunwale
of the boat into the water.</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Not very. Well, might as well plunge in at
once and have it over with.” Ned donned his
bathing suit in the cabin, and, a little later,
plunged over the side. He dived deeply, and
swam under the <i>Scud</i>. Up he came panting for
breath, for he was below the surface for some
time.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Jerry, as his chum clung to
the rail.</p>

<p>“It’s a tree—a big tree,” Ned reported. “We
slid right up on the inclined trunk. I don’t believe
we can get off until we all get out of the
boat.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to do that?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Andy, for no rowboat was towed behind the
<i>Scud</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll manage somehow,” Jerry replied.
“But first we’ll try shifting the weight, and see
what that does. How does she lie, Ned?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take another look, and tell you.”</p>

<p>The boy dived again, and, when he came up,
he said:</p>

<p>“If you all go in the stern, and on the port
side, I think that will raise the bow enough so
she’ll slip off. Try it.”</p>

<p>They did, but it was no use. The <i>Scud</i> was
still held fast.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get out,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll swim over to one of those boat
houses, and see if I can find a rowboat,” went
on Ned. “No use in everybody getting wet.”</p>

<p>Ned was lucky enough not only to find an available
boat, but to locate a man who offered to
help get the <i>Scud</i> off the submerged log. When
Bob, Jerry and Andy had been transferred to
the dock of the boathouse a plan of procedure
was worked out. A rope was attached to the
stern of the <i>Scud</i> and, the other end being carried
to shore, they all pulled on it.</p>

<p>The motor boat, being lightened of her load,
rode higher in the water, and when sufficient
force had been applied to the rope, she slid off
the log into deep water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Andy. “That’s the stuff!
Now we’re all right. Away again!”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet,” warned Jerry. “Those
leaks will have to be attended to. Is there a drydock
around here?” he asked the man who had
helped them.</p>

<p>“About three miles down the lake—yes.
Think you can make it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so, if we don’t have any more
hard luck.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad you ran on that tree,” the man
went on. “It must have drifted there lately. I’ll
mark it, and then get it out of the channel.
Well, good luck to you.”</p>

<p>The boys embarked once more, and started for
the boat yard. The water came in rapidly, but
by means of the hand and motor pumps it was
kept below the level of the cabin floor, and out
of the engine compartment. Then, on reaching
the place whither the man had directed them, the
<i>Scud</i> was put on the car of the marine railway,
and hauled out to have her seams caulked.</p>

<p>This would take two days, and she would need
a coat of paint below the water line, so the boys
found themselves with unexpected time on their
hands.</p>

<p>They made it pass as best they could, in the
small town where they had been forced to lie
over. Fortunately the place was a sort of summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
resort, and as the season was at its height
the boys did not lack for such amusements as
moving picture shows and other like attractions.
But they were glad when they could resume their
trip down the lake.</p>

<p>As Jerry had said, it was a large body of
water, and around its shores were many resorts
where cottagers and hotel guests spent the summer
months. The lake, too, was dotted with
pleasure craft of many sort, but the boys did
not stop to enjoy themselves as they might have
done.</p>

<p>“We can do that on the trip back, if we want
to,” said Jerry, little realizing how soon they
would come back that way again, and on what
an errand.</p>

<p>On they sped, now and then blowing their
whistle three times, in response to the salute of
some lake craft, the skipper of which recognized
a strange boat.</p>

<p>“That looks like a good place to eat,” observed
Bob, as they passed a large hotel, set in
the midst of beautiful gardens, that came down
to the water’s edge. “A fine place, all right!”</p>

<p>“I guess the <i>Scud’s</i> galley will do for the
present,” rejoined Jerry. “I want to see Professor
Snodgrass as soon as I can, and we’ve been
longer on this trip than I calculated.”</p>

<p>“Speed her up!” advised Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Hurdtown, where the professor had said he
would stay, was a small settlement, about a mile
from the northerly end of Lake Mogan. It was
in a lonely neighborhood, and it could be reached
only by boat.</p>

<p>There were no railroads near it, and no towns
of any size. It was a hunting district, but one not
very well known and, in consequence, not thickly
settled.</p>

<p>Inquiries made by the boys before reaching
the place where they expected to locate Professor
Snodgrass brought forth little or no information
concerning him. Their first queries resulted in
nothing. No one seemed to know anything about
a little bald-headed man, with a passion for bugs.
But, as they sent their boat into the swampy end
of the lake they saw, on the shore, a single cabin,
that looked as if it might be the home of a hermit.</p>

<p>An old man came to the door of the shack and,
in answer to their hail, gave them their first reliable
information.</p>

<p>“Yep, there’s a crazy feller up there in the
mountains,” the hermit said, nodding in the direction
the boys were taking.</p>

<p>“A crazy man?” repeated Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, suthin’s the matter of him. He picks
up bugs and puts ’em in a box. He says they’re
valuable. If that ain’t crazy I’d like to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
what is?” he asked, as if there were no disputing
his question.</p>

<p>Further talk with the man disclosed that he
had taken Professor Snodgrass and his belongings
up to a sort of hunting cabin, which the
little scientist was to make his headquarters.</p>

<p>“That’s the place for us, then,” announced
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Be you friends of his?” the hermit wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Humph! Queer he didn’t tell me he had
company comin’,” said the man, as if he had been
intentionally slighted.</p>

<p>“Well, he doesn’t expect us,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right then,” and the hermit
seemed relieved.</p>

<p>“Yep,” he went on, “folks most generally has
me take ’em up into the mountains when they
come here. I’m th’ only guide around here.
Think you fellers can find your way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess so, thank you,” replied Jerry.
“You say the trail is a straight one?”</p>

<p>“Fairly so, fairly. Keep on straight and
you’ll come to th’ cabin. There’s only one. You
can’t mistake it.”</p>

<p>The boys departed, thanking their informant.
They sent the boat to the extreme end of the
lake, mooring it in a little bay where it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
be safe. Then, having reached the water end
of their journey, they set off into the woods for
the last stage.</p>

<p>It was not easy traveling, for the trail was uphill
and rough, but they kept on, and finally
emerged into a little clearing which held a substantially
built log cabin.</p>

<p>“Here’s the place!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are some of the professor’s
nets!” exclaimed Bob, pointing to some with
long handles leaning against the side of the log
house.</p>

<p>“Hello, Professor Snodgrass!” shouted
Jerry. The echoes alone answered him. The
boys, with a vague feeling of alarm, pressed forward.
There was no sign of their friend and
as they looked into the cabin they did not see
him.</p>

<p>On a table were the remains of a meal, as
though it had been hastily abandoned, and the
condition of the food indicated that it had been
there several hours, if not days. The bread was
hard and dry, and many flies swarmed over the
food.</p>

<p>“Looks as though he’d gone,” said Bob, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“It does look like a deserted camp,” agreed
Jerry. “And yet, there are his nets.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>SEARCHING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Silently the boys stood in the deserted cabin.
For a moment it seemed as though they had come
to the end of the trail—that they were up against
a stone wall, and could go no farther. They had
counted so much on meeting their old friend that
not to find him was something of a shock. Jerry
was, perhaps, the most disappointed of all.</p>

<p>True, he harbored a slight feeling of resentment
against the scientist for the manner in which
he had acted in regard to the yellow clay—or,
rather, the manner in which Jerry feared his
friend might have acted.</p>

<p>But, the more Jerry thought it over, the more
convinced he was that his mother was right, and
that the professor had not been, and never could
be, guilty of any mean or underhand act.</p>

<p>So, in a measure, Jerry was prepared to forgive
Dr. Snodgrass, though, as a matter of fact,
there could be no forgiveness when there had
been no wrong done, and no accusation made.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t around, that’s sure,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Bob, as he went outside, in the vain hope that
he might see the professor coming along the
trail. But there was only the whispering of the
wind in the trees, and the tinkle of some distant
waterfall.</p>

<p>“He’s probably off after some bugs,” observed
Ned. “Of course we couldn’t expect to
find him here. I’ll wager he’s only in long enough
to get a meal, and then he hikes off again after
that two-tailed lizard, a pink frog, or something
equally absurd. He’s probably deep in the wilderness
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess the only thing for us to do is
to wait here until he comes back,” suggested
Jerry. “There looks to be room enough for all
of us here, and we brought plenty of grub along.”</p>

<p>“We sure did!” chuckled Bob. He had seen
to that.</p>

<p>“Maybe the professor’s hurt,” ventured Andy.</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?” asked Ned,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. You see, it’s so easy to
get hurt, or lost in the woods—a bear might
attack him, he might be bitten by a snake, his
gun might go off accidentally——”</p>

<p>Andy was working himself up to quite a pitch
of excitement.</p>

<p>“Here! You stow that kind of talk!” interrupted
Jerry. “The professor never carries a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
gun—he’s as harmless a hunter as a fellow with
a camera. Besides, there aren’t any bears in
these woods now.”</p>

<p>“Well, something must have happened,” insisted
Andy.</p>

<p>“Oh, get out, you old calamity howler!”
laughed Ned. “Now, fellows, we’re here, what’s
to be done?”</p>

<p>They looked about them, “sizing up the situation.”
They were in the midst of a clearing,
with big trees surrounding it. The “log hut”
was of very solid construction—a veritable hunting
lodge in the wilderness. There were several
rooms in it, a well-equipped kitchen, a living room
and bedrooms. Of course there were no electric
lights nor gas, for the place was far from a settlement,
but there were many comforts and conveniences.</p>

<p>In fact, it was such a place as a hunting party,
or even a gathering of men and women, could
live in and enjoy for a considerable time.</p>

<p>“I wonder how the professor stumbled on
this shack?” observed Bob, when they had looked
about, and taken drinks from a nearby spring,
which bubbled over with cold, clear, sparkling
water.</p>

<p>“Oh, he probably heard someone say there
was a two-tailed lizard spending his vacation up
here, and he put off for it hot-foot,” ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Jerry, little knowing how near he had guessed the
truth.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good place,” declared Bob. “We
can bring up our things from the boat and be as
‘snug as a bug in a rug.’ We don’t want to take
the professor’s grub.”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of stuff, though,” said Ned,
who had been to the kitchen pantry. And it did
seem as though the lodge was kept stocked in
preparation for visitors at any time.</p>

<p>“The professor never brought all this,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, it must have been here when he came,”
agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“He’d start off with a tooth brush and a collar
button, after he made sure he had his nets and
specimen boxes,” added Bob. “Well, come on,
let’s get busy and——”</p>

<p>“Eat!” interrupted Jerry, laughing.</p>

<p>“Score one,” went on Bob. “But I’m going
to watch you fellows stow away the grub. Come
on, Andy, we’ll rustle it up from the boat.”</p>

<p>They found, on inspection, that there were
enough blankets on the bunks so that they did not
have to carry any of their own up from the boat.
In the matter of food, too, they decided to leave
part of their stock aboard the <i>Scud</i>, and use part
of what was at the cabin.</p>

<p>“We can pay whoever it belongs to, or make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
some dicker with Professor Snodgrass,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>A little later they were sitting down to a comfortable
meal in the kitchen of the cabin. They
had cleared away the remains of food left by the
professor when he started out in a hurry on one
of his bug-hunting expeditions. The place was
made tidy, for that habit was now second nature
with the boys, and after the meal they sat about
to further discuss the situation.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re here, at all events,” remarked
Jerry, looking at his chums. “And now what
shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Have to wait for the professor; that’s all I
can see to do,” answered Ned. “We can’t learn
anything, or do anything, until we see him.”</p>

<p>“And that won’t be until night,” observed Bob.
“Might as well make ourselves comfortable
until then. I’m going to try to catch some fish
for supper.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” volunteered Andy, and
the two set off for the head of the lake, where
they had left the motor boat.</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry, with no particular object in
view, wandered about the camp. It was true
nothing could be done or learned until Dr. Snodgrass
returned, and the boys, knowing his eagerness
when he was searching for specimens, realized
he would not come back until called by darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Even the pangs of hunger were often
ignored by the little scientist.</p>

<p>“There’s no use trying to follow the trail, I
suppose,” observed Ned, after a time, which they
had occupied by looking about. They saw where
the professor had left his spare nets, and where
he had carefully put away his filled specimen
boxes. “That is,” went on Jerry’s chum, “until
there is some object in going after him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Jerry, impressed
by some note in Ned’s voice. “Are you
thinking of that stuff Andy talked?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know accidents will happen,”
replied Ned, a bit uneasily. He tried to laugh,
but it was not much of a success.</p>

<p>“Huh! You’ve got ’em too!” said Jerry.
“This solitary place must be getting on your
nerves.”</p>

<p>“It is lonesome enough for that,” admitted
Ned, involuntarily looking behind him, into the
deep and silent woods.</p>

<p>Certainly the camp was not lively, but the boys
were used to lonesome places.</p>

<p>“Here come the boys,” remarked Jerry a little
later, as a crashing was heard in the underbrush
along the trail.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the professor,” suggested Ned,
hopefully.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t make as much racket as that,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
objected Jerry. “He’d be too afraid of scaring
off the two-tailed lizard.”</p>

<p>And Jerry’s prediction was right—it was Bob
and Andy returning with a good catch of fish—perch
and sunnies.</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of the professor?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No. Did you expect us to?” returned Bob,
in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I only thought you might,” was the
evasive reply.</p>

<p>They sat about after supper, listening to the
chirp of the crickets, and a few early katydids.
The darkness was slowly falling and the woods
were becoming more gloomy and dismal. Now
and then, off in the forest, there was a crashing
sound, as some dead limb of a tree fell, or a
decayed monarch of the forest crashed to the
ground, unable longer to repel the inroads of
time.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll light up,” spoke Jerry, when they
could no longer see each other’s faces as they sat
on a bench in front of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Yes, the professor will be able to see where
his camp is,” said Ned. “Won’t he be surprised
when he finds us here, though?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>They waited, more and more impatiently as
the hours passed. They went inside, for the mosquitoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and gnats made life miserable outside,
especially after the lanterns were aglow.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock came, and it seemed like midnight.</p>

<p>“He won’t come now,” observed Bob, yawning
sleepily. “He may stay out all night.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, he may,” agreed Jerry. “It
wouldn’t be the first time. That two-tailed lizard
may only come out after dark, and the professor
may have a portable camping outfit with him.
He knows how to take care of himself, at any
rate.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s turn in,” suggested Ned. “We
can leave a light burning, and we’ll hear him
when he comes in.”</p>

<p>They were all tired and sleepy, and they realized
that no good could come of remaining up.
So they turned in, to sleep fitfully at first, and
then with the heaviness and abandon of healthy
boyhood.</p>

<p>“Did he come?” was Bob’s first question on
awakening in the morning. Jerry was up, making
coffee.</p>

<p>“No,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“Then we’d better hit the trail after him,”
suggested Ned, as he, too, roused.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” replied Jerry. “We’ll
try to find him.”</p>

<p>And, after breakfast, they took up the search
for the missing professor.</p>

</div>


<p>“Now, boys,” began Jerry Hopkins, who
seemed to take the leadership in this crisis,
“we’ve got to map out a plan of work for ourselves.
It won’t do to go at this thing haphazard,
or hit and miss. We’ve got to have a system.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, old man!” exclaimed Ned.
“Go on, map it out, and we’ll be with you.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we yell—fire guns—build a signal
fire—climb a tall tree—find the professor that
way!” cried Andy Rush, with his usual impetuosity.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we don’t want to do,” replied
Jerry, calmly, for Andy was hurrying about
in a manner that befitted his name, darting here
and there toward several paths that led into the
woods.</p>

<p>“Don’t we want to find him?” asked the small
chap, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Of course, but that’s not the way to go about
it,” advised Jerry. “We’ve got to find the right
trail, and that isn’t going to be so easy when there
are several he might have taken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s follow the one that shows the freshest
footprints, then,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That isn’t easy to determine, either,” Jerry
said. “We’ve tramped about here so much that
we’ve covered up any marks that might have
helped us.”</p>

<p>“Then what can we do?” Ned wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Jerry slowly, “we’ll have to
make a start on each of these trails, of course.
Then when we find one doesn’t pan out we’ll try
another.</p>

<p>“My notion,” he went on, “is that the professor
used each and every one of these woodland
paths. But he only used one the last time, and
on that there will be no return marks. Now
the thing for us to do is to find that last trail,
and the only way we can do that is to pick out
the one with the freshest marks—that is, the one
that shows the freshest marks after we have gone
beyond the point where we, ourselves, tramped.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” cried Ned. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Jerry’s plan was the only feasible one. They
must explore each woodland trail until they came
on the one which showed it had last been used
by the professor. Then they could follow it until
they either found him, or found where the trail
ended.</p>

<p>Fortunately the boys were experienced woodsmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
They were not expert guides, but they
knew enough to follow a trail, and also to blaze
one for themselves. They had had experience
in this.</p>

<p>“Now,” resumed Jerry, after they had settled
this point, “we must pack along some grub, for
it won’t do to have to come back to the cabin at
noon for something to eat. That would waste
too much time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look after the grub,” offered Bob.</p>

<p>“I thought you would, Chunky,” said Jerry,
with a laugh. “And the rest of us will take what
things we need.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stay out all night?” asked Andy, a
bit apprehensively. He was not used, as were
the others, to roughing it.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that would be wise,” replied
Jerry. “We will divide up the time so that
we can use half of the daylight hours in going
in a direction away from the cabin, and the other
half in returning. We’ll take a compass, so as
not to get lost, and we’ll come back by a different
route than the one we use going out. That
will cover two trails, or paths, every day,
and——”</p>

<p>“How many days do you think we’re going to
spend on this search?” asked Ned, with an anxious
look at Jerry.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling,” and Jerry’s voice took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
on a solemn tone that made his chums look at
him in wonder.</p>

<p>“Maybe the professor will come back while
we’re out looking for him,” suggested Bob, who
was busy putting up the lunch.</p>

<p>“That’s right—he may,” agreed Jerry, “and
to let him know that we are here, and will be
back, we’ll leave a note for him that will explain
matters.”</p>

<p>“He’ll wonder why we came up here after
him,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t explain that—in the note,”
returned Jerry. “There will be time enough
when we see him.”</p>

<p>They were soon ready to start. The cabin
had not been locked when they reached it, and
they did not now fasten the door. The note was
left in plain sight on the dining table.</p>

<p>They began at the trail farthest to the left of
the cabin, intending to work to the right. There
were several of these narrow paths leading into
the woods, all of them in front of the cabin,
except one, and that was at the back, going off
into the woods beyond the spring. They decided
to leave that until the last.</p>

<p>“Forward, march!” cried Jerry, as they set
off. He took careful note of their direction by
the compass and was sure they could find the
cabin again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not weary you with an account of their
exploration of all those trails. Suffice it to say
that they soon exhausted the possibilities of the
first three. Before noon they had demonstrated
that the professor could have used none of them,
save for a short distance, unless he possessed an
airship, which they hardly believed possible,
though more than once he had gone in theirs after
bugs and other specimens.</p>

<p>But the first three trails, after straggling into
the wilderness for a mile or so, became so overgrown
with forest growth that it was evident
they had not been used in a year or more. There
was no use going along them.</p>

<p>The fourth was more promising, and showed
plainly that the professor, or some one, had
passed along it recently. The boys were quite
sure it was Dr. Snodgrass, for the footprints
showed the nail pattern of the shoes worn by
the scientist. He was very particular about his
tramping shoes, and always had them made to
order.</p>

<p>“Though of course someone else might have
his shoes made at the same place, and, naturally,
the shoemaker would use the hob-nails in the
same way,” observed Ned. “But I believe this
was where the professor walked.”</p>

<p>The others were sure also, but the certainty
did them little good, for they found where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
person, whoever he was, had doubled back on
his own trail.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to give this up,” said Jerry, “but
it is getting more hopeful. Try the next one.”</p>

<p>This resulted in nothing. The trail was a blind
one. But the one after that, which they started
out on shortly after eating their lunch, at once
raised new hope in their hearts. There were
unmistakable signs that it had been traveled recently,
and the peculiar marks of the hob-nailed
shoes were very plain.</p>

<p>“We’ll find him!” cried Bob, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>But they were not destined to have matters so
easy as they ventured to hope. The signs became
more and more pronounced as they advanced,
and there was no back-track.</p>

<p>“He surely must have gotten on the trail of
the two-tailed lizard this time,” exulted Ned.
“Now we’ll find him, and we’ll probably see him
camping out under a hut of boughs, studying the
habits of the lizard, so he can write a book about
it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>They tramped on, and so eager and enthusiastic
did they become that they failed to note
the passage of time. It grew dark almost before
they realized it, and Jerry, coming to a halt in a
dense glade, where the shadows were long and
gloomy, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on, fellows, we can’t keep this up.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Because we’ll have to spend the night in the
woods if we do. We can’t get back before nightfall,
as it is, and this trail goes on, as you can
see.”</p>

<p>Indeed the marks of the hob-nailed shoes were
still plainly to be seen in the soft ground.</p>

<p>“Just a little farther,” pleaded Bob, and
Jerry gave in, against his better judgment.</p>

<p>But finally the tall leader called a halt.</p>

<p>“Fellows, we really must go back,” he said.
“We can take up this trail the first thing in the
morning, and then we can come prepared for a
night in the woods, if need be. But we must go
back now.”</p>

<p>“But what about the professor?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can do nothing for him. He
may be all right, and he may not. He may be
in need of help, but we can help him best by
going back now, and starting out again. It will
soon be so dark that we can’t see the trail, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly they turned back. Jerry had spoken
truly. They could not see the trail, and, in spite
of blaze marks, and the compass, they were soon
uncertain of their locality. They tried to go by
the stars, and to follow the path by the light of
an electric flashlight they carried, but several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
times they got off the trail. Finally Jerry said:</p>

<p>“Fellows, we’re only getting worse instead of
better. We’ve got to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>“All night—without a tent!” faltered Andy.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s nothing,” laughed Jerry. “It’s
warm, and we’ve often done it; haven’t we, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” echoed Ned and Bob, and the latter
added:</p>

<p>“I wish we’d saved more grub.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it won’t be the first time we’ve gone
hungry,” consoled Jerry, though his own stomach
felt gnawing pangs.</p>

<p>They made the best of an unpleasant situation.
Some evergreen boughs were cut, and a rude sort
of shelter made. Under this they crawled, to
pass the long hours of darkness. It was no fun
waiting thus for morning to come, but the boys
did not always look for fun.</p>

<p>They were astir with the first streak of dawn,
and then they saw how needless had been their
suffering.</p>

<p>For they had spent the night in the open, not
half a mile from the comfortable cabin. Only
they were not familiar enough with the woods
to recognize how near “home” they were.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Ned,
when this fact was borne in to them.</p>

<p>“No use crying over spilled milk,” consoled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Jerry. “Let’s have breakfast and then we’ll
start out again.”</p>

<p>And never had a breakfast tasted so delicious.</p>

<p>They made fast time back along the trail again,
carrying with them enough food to last for some
time, though they expected to be back in the cabin
by night. They soon reached and passed the
point where they had turned back before, and
hurried on, alert for what they might find.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jerry, who was in the lead, uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>“Have you found him?” called Ned, pressing
forward.</p>

<p>“No, but look here!”</p>

<p>They all hastened to where Jerry stood on the
brink of what they saw was a deep gulch. There,
on the edge, were the unmistakable signs of someone
having slipped over. The earth and grass
was torn, as though the person had vainly tried
to prevent a fall.</p>

<p>“Is it—is he——” faltered Andy.</p>

<p>“Look,” answered Jerry. And, as they gazed
over the brink, they saw, lying in a huddled heap
at the bottom of the gulch, the figure of a man.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>DISCLOSURES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Is it—is it the professor?” gasped Andy,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure it is,” replied Jerry, “though
of course I may be mistaken. But we must find
out at once. And, whoever it is will be in need
of help. Someone must go down there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” offered Ned. He was lighter than
Jerry, and more lively on his feet than Bob. In
fact, Bob’s accident had made him a bit timid.
Andy could hardly be trusted to go down into
the deep gully, so Ned was really the only available
person.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” he said again. “What’ll I do,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Find out who it is—and if—if he is living,”
replied the tall lad slowly. “Then we’ll have to
plan some way of getting him up here.”</p>

<p>Ned laid aside the pack he had been carrying,
and took off his coat. He wanted to be unhampered.</p>

<p>At the point where the trail ended, the gully’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sides were steep. As a matter of fact, as the boys
learned later, the correct trail really swung aside
from the gully, at that point, and went down into
it at a place farther distant. But whoever had
fallen over the precipice had evidently followed
a false trail, and so, unexpectedly, had toppled
over, perhaps in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Can you get down, Ned?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy I can manage it,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Ned had quickly located a place where the descent
was easier than where the unfortunate man
had fallen, and, a little later, the lad was scrambling
down the slope toward the bottom.</p>

<p>Now and then, on the way down, he paused
to pick out a less dangerous path, and then he
kept on. Dirt and stones, dislodged by his progress,
rattled toward the bottom. But that silent,
huddled-up figure never moved, nor showed signs
of life. The boys on the brink felt an ominous
chill at their hearts.</p>

<p>Ned reached the bottom of the gully. Pausing
only an instant to get his breath, he hurried
toward the prostrate figure of the man, for he
had come down some distance beyond him.</p>

<p>“Is it the professor?” Jerry hailed his chum
from the height.</p>

<p>“Yes,” floated up the answer, faintly.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to determine the identity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is he—alive?” was the next question.</p>

<p>To Ned it did not seem so, for the figure was
very still. Overcoming a natural hesitancy, Ned
placed his hand over the professor’s heart. He
detected a slight beat, so faint as to be almost
imperceptible.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Yes—he’s alive—just about,” Ned called up</a>,
after a moment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">

  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="382" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_201">“YES—HE’S ALIVE—JUST ABOUT,” NED CALLED UP.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Badly hurt?” asked Jerry, next.</p>

<p>“Hard to say,” was Ned’s reply. “We’ve got
to get him up, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Jerry shouted back. And then,
with him, the problem became one of deciding
how best to aid the luckless professor.</p>

<p>“I’m coming down, Ned,” Jerry called, a little
later. Clearly it was a problem for more than
one head to solve.</p>

<p>“You fellows go back to the cabin, and get
some ropes and one of the cot beds,” Jerry directed
Bob and Andy. “You’ll find the rope in
the corner of the living room. Bring all there is.
We’ll have to haul him up. We can’t carry him
up this slope.”</p>

<p>Jerry had already sketched out, in his mind,
a plan of rescue.</p>

<p>“Lively now!” he called to Bob and Andy,
as they set off along the back trail.</p>

<p>Then Jerry joined Ned at the bottom of the
gulch. It was no easy task, and once Jerry slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and almost plunged down the steep slope, but
saved himself by clutching at some bushes.</p>

<p>Together, as gently as they could, Ned and
Jerry straightened out the form of the professor.
He had fallen in a heap, but no limbs appeared to
be broken. There was a cut on his head, and
this had bled considerably, but the blood had
coagulated. That seemed to be the most serious
injury, and the one that had made the scientist
unconscious.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had not been rendered
senseless at once, for it was evident that he had
both eaten and drunk after falling down, since
his water flask lay empty beside him, and there
was an empty basket of food, with crumbs scattered
about, showing that he had been able to
help himself after receiving his hurts.</p>

<p>“How we going to get him up?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Put him on a cot, tie ropes to each end, and
hoist him up—that’s the only way I see,” announced
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right. He must have had a
bad fall.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the tall lad. “He was probably
chasing after some bug, or butterfly, and
came to the edge of the cliff before he realized
it. I wonder what his chances are?”</p>

<p>It seemed many hours to Ned and Jerry, down
there with the unconscious form of the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
waiting for the return of Bob and Andy. Yet it
really was not long, for the two boys made fast
time. Meanwhile the professor had been made
as comfortable as possible. His specimen boxes
were beside him.</p>

<p>“There they are!” cried Ned, looking up to
the top of the cliff. Bob and Andy were there.</p>

<p>“Lower the cot,” Jerry directed them, and
when it came on the end of a long rope, the legs
were left folded under it, and the professor was
placed on it, as on a stretcher, being covered with
blankets the boys had brought from the cabin.</p>

<p>“Now to see if we can haul him up,” suggested
Jerry, as he attached short ropes, for slings, at
either end of the improvised stretcher.</p>

<p>“They can’t do it alone,” said Ned, motioning
to Bob and Andy.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll have to go up and help them pull,”
agreed Jerry. It was hard work—harder than
the boys had ever before attempted—or so they
thought, at least.</p>

<p>It was finally done, however, and there he lay,
stretched out on the cot.</p>

<p>“And now for camp!” cried Jerry. “Carry
him as gently as possible.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to force their way along
the trail, carrying the form of the scientist, but
the boys managed it. It seemed as though their
arms would be pulled out before they got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
cabin, but they did not give up, and finally they
reached the lonely camp.</p>

<p>“We must get him into a bunk,” Jerry decided.</p>

<p>They did so, removing most of his clothes.
Then Jerry bathed the wound on the head. As
the blood was washed away the lad saw that it
was no ordinary cut.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid his skull is fractured,” said Jerry.
“We’ll need the best doctor we can get.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better take the boat, and ask that
old hermit where one can be found,” suggested
Ned. “Andy and I will go.”</p>

<p>“I guess that will be a good idea,” rejoined
Jerry.</p>

<p>While the two were getting ready to set off,
Jerry and Bob managed to get a little cold water
between the professor’s lips. This appeared to
have its effect, for the eyelids were lifted from
the glassy orbs. And then a hoarse voice muttered:</p>

<p>“The papers—letters—a mistake—I have
them. The yellow clay—I didn’t know—so
valuable—sorry—Jerry—your mother—the papers—I
can prove—they shouldn’t have the land—a
fraud—I can give evidence—soon as—two-tailed
lizard—I must have it—boys must think
me—Oh—Oh!” and his voice ended in a shriek.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums looked with startled eyes
at one another. What did this disclosure mean?</p>

<small>OFF FOR HELP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Professor Snodgrass lay quiet after his outburst.
He fell back on the cot, from which he
had raised himself, and his relaxed features took
on a paler hue.</p>

<p>“Some more of that ammonia!” cried Jerry,
for they had been trying to rouse the scientist by
doses of that valuable stimulant. A little was
forced between his lips, but it availed only for a
moment, and then he sank back into a coma.</p>

<p>“Something must be done!” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and pretty soon, too,” added Ned. He
looked at Jerry for a solution of the problem.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go for help,” responded the
tall lad. “We can’t possibly treat him ourselves.
There must be a doctor somewhere around.”</p>

<p>“If we only had Dr. Wright!” sighed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t got him, and can’t get him,”
observed Jerry. “We’ll have to do the best we
can. Now, then, let’s consider what it is.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he meant by all that talk?”
ventured Andy. “It sure did sound mighty
queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t consider that now,” spoke Jerry.
“I have an idea it had something to do with
those men who are digging the yellow clay, but
I can’t be sure. Our first care must be to get
the professor attended to, and we can ask him
questions later—if he gets better,” Jerry added,
dubiously.</p>

<p>There had come into his mind not one thought
that the little scientist might have been disloyal
to him and his mother. Jerry was big hearted,
and big minded, enough not to consider that for
a moment.</p>

<p>True, Dr. Snodgrass might have played into
the hands of the enemy, knowingly or unknowingly;
but, for all that, he was now in danger,
and Jerry was not the lad to hold back.</p>

<p>“He spoke of letters—papers,” said Ned,
vaguely.</p>

<p>“Yes. Maybe they’re in there,” returned
Jerry, nodding toward the specimen boxes and
leather cases, which had been near the professor
when they picked him up after his fall over the
cliff. “We won’t disturb them, though, until we
find out how this is going to end,” and he looked
at the unconscious form.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s do something,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Bob. “But what?”</p>

<p>“The doctor—first of all,” exclaimed Jerry.
“Ned, do you think you and Andy could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the trip in the boat down to where that old hermit
lived? He may know where we can find a
local physician.”</p>

<p>“Of course we can go!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Then you’d better start. I don’t know just
what sort of treatment may be needed, but it
seems as though it will mean an operation. And
the sooner it’s done, the better chance Professor
Snodgrass will have.”</p>

<p>“We’re off!” cried Ned. “Come on, Andy.”</p>

<p>Be it said to the credit of the small chap that
he kept his head admirably in this emergency.
He was neither excited, nor did he make his
chums nervous by his rapid-fire talk, as he sometimes
did.</p>

<p>While Ned and Andy were on their way to the
moored motor boat to get help, Jerry and Bob
made Professor Snodgrass as comfortable as possible.
There was little they could do, however,
that they had not already done. Or, rather, they
were afraid of moving or disturbing him too
much, for fear of making his injuries worse.</p>

<p>The afflicted man moaned once or twice, and
moved uneasily on the cot bed. Now and then
he mumbled something; but what it was neither
Jerry nor Bob could distinguish. Once, however,
Jerry heard the professor say:</p>

<p>“I can prove it! I’ll not let them keep the
land! It was a fraud on me and on them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Bob, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned Jerry. “He may hear
you. I fancy he is talking about that clay deposit
in our swamp.”</p>

<p>“And maybe he knows something that will let
your mother get the land back,” suggested the
stout lad.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” assented Jerry. But he had little
hope.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ned and Andy were on their way.
There were still several hours of daylight left,
and they must make the most of them. The need
of a doctor was imperative.</p>

<p>The boat was soon chugging its way down the
lake to where the old hermit, who once before
had directed the boys, lived in his lonely cabin.
He was fishing from a leaky old boat, not far
from shore, when the boys puffed up in their craft.</p>

<p>“Easy! Easy!” called the old man, in fretful
tones. “You’ll scare all the fish, boys.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it! We’re sorry!” exclaimed
Ned. “But a friend of ours is hurt. Is there
any doctor around here?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Someone hurt? That’s too bad! And
you need a doctor?” asked the old man, winding
in his line.</p>

<p>“Do you know of anyone?” demanded Ned,
a bit impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, yes—that is, Dr. Brown has an office
in Tuckerton. He’s a young chap, but pretty
good, they say.”</p>

<p>“And where is Tuckerton?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“About ten miles down the lake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Andy. “That’s a
good way to go for a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Folks up here don’t mind going twice
that far,” retorted the hermit. “But hold on!
Maybe you can do better than that. Dr. Brown
has a patient up here—Old Betsy Blain—about
a mile back in the woods,” and he indicated a
point back of his log cabin. “The doctor comes
to see her twice a week,” the man went on, “and
to-day is one of the times. If you hustle over
there you may catch him.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth trying, anyhow!” exclaimed Ned.
“How can we find the place?”</p>

<p>“There’s a plain trail, back of my shack,” the
hermit went on. “You can’t miss it. Betsy’s
cabin is the first one you come to. They can tell
you there whether the doctor has called to-day
or not. If he has, and is gone, you’ll have to
go on to his office, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Andy!” called Ned. “It’s worth
a try.”</p>

<p>They tied the motor boat at the small dock
near the hermit’s shack, and set off at a fast
pace through the woods. As the old man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
said his name was Peter Wantage, had indicated,
the trail was a very plain one, and Ned and
Andy soon arrived at the cabin in question. In
front they saw a horse and carriage tied, and
Ned exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The doctor, I’ll wager! We’re in luck.”</p>

<p>“Looks so,” agreed Andy.</p>

<p>And so it proved. An old woman, sitting in
front of the cabin, nodded at the boys as they
walked up the dirt path. A yellow dog came
out, barking at them, but subsided, and wagged
his tail in friendly fashion, at a rebuke from the
old woman.</p>

<p>“Is the doctor here?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Jest goin’,” was the answer, and a little later
a tall, slim gentleman, with a professional air
about him, came out. He seemed a bit surprised
at seeing the boys, for, clearly, they were not of
the class of dwellers in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for me?” asked Dr. Brown,
for it was he.</p>

<p>“Yes!” exclaimed Ned eagerly, and in a few
words he explained what had happened.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you at once, of course,” said the
doctor, gravely. He turned to his horse.</p>

<p>“We can take you there much quicker in the
motor boat,” declared Ned. “You can leave
your horse here, or at Mr. Wantage’s place, and
we’ll bring you back there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very good,” assented Dr. Brown. “But I
fancy I had better leave Prince here. It isn’t a
very good road in to Wantage’s place. I’ll leave
him here.”</p>

<p>Nodding good-bye to the old woman the doctor
set off after Ned and Andy. The walk back
to where they had left the motor boat did not
take long, and it seemed very short, for the physician,
who carried his black bag, asked all sort
of questions concerning the accident to Professor
Snodgrass. Of course Ned and Andy could tell
him little as to the nature of the injury.</p>

<p>To Jerry and Bob, waiting in the lonely cabin,
beside the injured man, the absence of Ned and
Andy seemed a long one. But really they made
very good time, and bringing the doctor back with
them was a distinct advantage.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown walked in and stood over the
slowly-breathing professor. He looked at him
critically, lifted up the lids of the closed eyes, and
then examined the hurt on the head. Then he
straightened up with a long breath.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>“An operation is needed,” said Dr. Brown
slowly. “And of such a delicate nature that I
dare not perform it. I have not had experience
enough. It needs a skilled hand to do what is
needed to save his life. I dare not attempt it!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>A RACE FOR A LIFE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry and his chums looked blankly at one
another. They had had very little experience in
illness and accidents, though, often enough, they
had been in tight places, and had been hurt. But
they were unacquainted with the necessity for
delicate surgical operations, and ignorant of
their requirements. In a general way they
thought that a doctor was all that was needed,
and that one doctor was about as good as, or
equal to, another. Now they could scarcely
understand why Dr. Brown himself could not
do what was necessary.</p>

<p>“You say he needs an operation?” questioned
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, a delicate one, if his life is to be saved,
and it must be performed quickly.”</p>

<p>“Then why can’t you do it?” asked impulsive
Bob.</p>

<p>“Because I have not the necessary skill. I
can perform some operations, it is true, and I
have done so. In fact, if we were outside of the
pale of civilization, I would attempt this one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
But when other and more experienced surgeons
can be obtained, I would be guilty of unprofessional
conduct did I not advise you to seek some
other practitioner. I will do what I can, of
course, until he comes, but the operating surgeon
must be someone else.” The doctor spoke decidedly.
Clearly he was carefully considering
the matter.</p>

<p>“What sort of an operation is it?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It is on the head—there is some sort of a
fracture—a bone is pressing on the brain,” was
the answer. “Delicate instruments which I have
not, and a skillful assistant and nurse, are needed
to perform the operation; especially up here in
the wilderness where there are none of the conveniences
of a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to go for another doctor,”
spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“In my opinion, yes. And only one surgeon in
this country is capable of successfully performing
that operation.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Ned, as the country
physician paused.</p>

<p>“He is Dr. Wallace Wright of New York, and
it is doubtful if he could be induced to come away
up here, even if he could be brought here in time.
He is a celebrated surgeon—a high-priced one—and
in great demand. I doubt if you could get
him.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Dr. Wright’s name the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
looked at one another. Unconsciously Bob put
his hand to his head, which the great surgeon
had sewed up. Something in the faces of the
boys made Dr. Brown ask:</p>

<p>“Have you heard of Dr. Wright?”</p>

<p>“He recently treated me,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Indeed. Then you must have made a remarkable
recovery,” Dr. Brown said. “For Dr.
Wright seldom operates unless the case is a serious
one, and you do not look as though you had
recently been under his hands.”</p>

<p>“It was only a small scalp wound,” Bob explained.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get any other doctor,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“What! Couldn’t get any other doctor in
New York?” cried the country practitioner.
“You surprise me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it wasn’t in New York. It was not
far from here, at a place called Brookville,”
went on Jerry. “Dr. Wright, if he is the same
one you mean, is stopping there on his vacation.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be mistaken in the man,” said Dr.
Brown, and he quickly described him, for he had
heard him lecture in college several times.</p>

<p>“That is he!” exclaimed Jerry. “He isn’t so
far away as you thought, Dr. Brown.”</p>

<p>“No, but there is still the almost impossible
task of getting him to come up here; to this lonely
place, to perform an operation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I can get him to come,” said Jerry,
slowly. “I will explain matters to him, and tell
him how necessary it is that the professor be
saved—not only for the aid he may give my
mother in her affairs, but for the sake of the
world of science.”</p>

<p>“It is barely possible that the appeal to science
may move him,” conceded Dr. Brown. “How
are you going to get to Brookville? That is some
distance away.”</p>

<p>“We can go part way in the motor boat, and
the rest of the way in our auto,” Ned explained.
“We left our car at Waydell. We can pick it up
there.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” exclaimed the physician.
“Now, then, you had better make your preparations
at once. It will take you nearly three
days to go down there, get Dr. Wright and get
back here. If we were near a railroad it would
be easier; but we are not. There is every need
for haste! I’ll write that note at once.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll get ready to go,” said Jerry.
“Bob, you and I will make the trip by auto and
boat. Ned and Andy will stay here with the
professor.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll stay, too!” exclaimed Dr. Brown.
“He should not be left without medical attendance.
You may tell Dr. Wright that I am with
the patient.”</p>

<p>Ned and Andy looked relieved at hearing this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Little beyond some food, and some extra
clothing, was taken by Jerry and Bob. The
motor boat was well stocked, and there was plenty
of oil and gasoline for the trip to Waydell. Another
supply could be put aboard there while the
remainder of the trip was being made in the auto.</p>

<p>“You can stop at the hermit’s, and send word
to have my horse taken to my home,” said Dr.
Brown, as he handed Jerry the note for Dr.
Wright. “I will stay here until you return.
Now go, and good luck go with you.”</p>

<p>It was nearly five o’clock in the afternoon when
Jerry and Bob started off in the boat. They had
taken a last look at Professor Snodgrass. The
scientist had roused a little, and had seemed to
recognize Jerry, for he had murmured, looking
full at the tall lad:</p>

<p>“Don’t mind—it’s all right—I have the papers—the
yellow mud—I’ll explain—the scoundrels—the
two-tailed——” and then he lapsed
into unconsciousness again.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bob!” exclaimed Jerry, grimly.
“This is a race to save a life!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE BROKEN SPRING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Away from the small dock shot the motor boat.
Jerry and Bob had called on the hermit, at the
request of Dr. Brown, to leave word about the
physician’s horse. Dr. Brown had also written
a note to a fellow practitioner, asking him to take
charge of the patients, who, otherwise, would be
left without medical attention.</p>

<p>“And now for a fast run!” exclaimed Jerry,
as he stood at the wheel. “Is everything ready
for to-night, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got the grub all laid out, and I’ll
make a pot of coffee and put it in the vacuum
bottle to keep hot. I’ll have some sandwiches,
and——”</p>

<p>“Say, do you think I mean nothing but grub?”
cried Jerry, but he could not help smiling at his
chum.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to eat; haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Sure! But what I meant was to have some
extra oil in readiness, a spare spark plug or two,
and things like that. We’re going to run all
night, you know, and it won’t be so easy to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
things up in the dark, even if we are pretty well
lighted up aboard here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” assented Bob. “I’ll look
after things. But the grub’s ready, too.”</p>

<p>“Trust you not to forget that,” laughed
Jerry. “Well, we’ll need that, too.”</p>

<p>They kept on down the lake. As Jerry had
said, their trip on it, and their progress on Silver
River had made them fairly familiar with the
peculiarities of the waterway. Aside from having
run on the submerged log, they had had no
accidents, if we except the fire, which did them
no damage. And, as there would be a moon, and
they could keep in the center of the lake, there
was really little danger to be apprehended from
the night trip.</p>

<p>Still Jerry and Bob were not a little nervous
as darkness settled down. They had gone
through much in the last few hours, and to their
natural anxiety regarding Professor Snodgrass
there was added, in Jerry’s case, the feeling that
if the scientist died without revealing what he
knew about Mrs. Hopkins’s land, it might mean
financial ruin for her.</p>

<p>“I must get help back to him in time!”
thought Jerry, desperately. “Dr. Wright simply
must come and perform that operation. But
it won’t be an easy thing to do—up there in the
wilderness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately for Bob he was of a less nervous
temperament than was Jerry. He was not so
anxious, and, to be sure, he did not have so much
at stake.</p>

<p>So Bob kept himself busy arranging matters
for the night, seeing that the electric bulbs were
working, and that the emergency oil lamps were
in readiness.</p>

<p>“Grub’s ready, Jerry,” finally announced the
stout lad, emerging from the galley, where he
had been busy over the gasoline stove. “Come
on down and eat, Jerry. I’ll steer while you
stow away some grub.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, Chunky,” was the answer.
“But I’m in no hurry. I’m not a bit hungry.
You eat first, and then you can relieve me.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure. I don’t want to eat now.”</p>

<p>Jerry fancied he heard a sigh of relief from
the stout lad, and he smiled as he shifted the
helm. Truly Bob did like to eat!</p>

<p>“All right now; I’ve had enough. I’m through,
but there’s plenty left,” Bob announced a little
later. “Come on, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“All right. You can take the wheel.”</p>

<p>“How are you heading her?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, no special course. The lake’s deep
enough, except close to shore, to go almost anywhere.
Just keep her as near the center as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
can. We ought to fetch the river at this rate,
about morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be quite a trip,” observed Bob,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the hardest part will be bringing
back the doctor,” remarked Jerry. “That will
be the last lap.”</p>

<p>He relinquished the wheel to Bob, and went
into the cabin. Jerry’s chum had spread out a
substantial repast. It was simple enough, for
not a great variety could be carried on the <i>Scud</i>.
But Jerry was not very hungry. His anxiety
had taken away his appetite in a great measure.
Still, he managed to make a fairly good meal.</p>

<p>Jerry arranged to take the first watch that
night, and, after Bob had sat up with his chum
for some time, while the boat glided past the
distant villages on the shores of the lake, the
stout youth began to yawn.</p>

<p>“Better turn in,” suggested Jerry. “I can
manage until one o’clock, and then I’ll call you.”</p>

<p>“Will you—sure?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure. Go to bed.”</p>

<p>And Bob was glad enough to crowd into his
bunk.</p>

<p>It was nearer two o’clock than one, as Bob
learned by looking at his watch under his pillow,
when he roused. Jerry had not called him; Bob
had awakened by himself, and, to his surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the boat was not moving. Or, rather, she was
not moving under the power of her engine. She
was merely drifting.</p>

<p>Bob sat up, and peered into the motor compartment.
He saw Jerry bending over the machinery.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” cried the stout lad, sliding out
of his berth.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re awake; are you?” asked the tall
lad. “A little accident, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Accident! Why didn’t you call me?” demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought I’d let you sleep. I didn’t
feel a bit like turning in, and I didn’t need you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the accident. What is it?”</p>

<p>“A valve spring has broken. We can’t very
well go on without one, and I can’t seem to find
an extra part. I thought we had some, but I
haven’t come across them.” He was rummaging
in a tool box. Meanwhile the <i>Scud</i> was drifting
under the influence of a little wind and a slight
current in the lake.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” asked Bob,
helplessly.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to fix it,” said Jerry, “but I
haven’t had much success. I can’t make this
makeshift spring stay in place. It needs someone
to hold it.”</p>

<p>“Would the motor work if that spring was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
held tight—I mean that one you’ve put in?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes. She’d go all right then. I’ve tried to
rig up some way to tie the spring with a cord,
and fasten it to some part of the engine, but that
makes it too stiff. It needs a hand to hold it—someone
who could ease down just at the right
time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said Bob quickly, as he saw where
Jerry had used part of a spring from another
spare part of the motor, and a cord to give the
necessary tension. But, as the tall lad had said,
it needed a human hand to hold it, to make just
the right pull, to provide for the automatic opening
and closing of the valve.</p>

<p>“You can’t hold it,” objected Jerry. “It will
mean hours of remaining in one position, and
your hand’ll ache like the mischief.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” responded Bob quietly. “We’ve
got to make this trip as fast as we can, and we
haven’t any time to lay up for repairs. I’ll hold
the broken spring.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jerry. “Then we’ll take
turns at it. It’ll be hard work, and no fun having
to stay so close to the hot motor. But if
we can do it——”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it!” interrupted Bob grimly.

<small>THE LAST LAP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The night would never pass, it seemed, yet
slowly the hours of darkness crept onward. To
Jerry and Bob, first one and then the other,
crouched in the cramped motor compartment,
holding the string of the tension spring, which
alone kept the machinery in motion, the sixty
minutes in each hour seemed like sixty thousand.</p>

<p>They had passed from the lake into the river,
and but a comparatively few miles now separated
them from the place where the auto had been
left. The land part of their journey would take
them until nearly night, they calculated.</p>

<p>It was now fully light, and still they sped on.
Neither of them could desert his post. Jerry
managed, by lashing the steering wheel, to snatch
a few moments during which he rushed into the
galley, and set the coffee to boiling. Then he
was back at the helm again, for the boat was
driving herself on shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The two chums ate a hasty meal at their posts,
Bob in the motor room, Jerry at the wheel.</p>

<p>It was shortly before noon when they guided
the <i>Scud</i> up to Kroll’s boat dock, and as they
made their craft fast, and scrambled out, taking
only a few belongings with them, one of the
workmen cried:</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Can’t stop to tell now,” Jerry shouted back
over his shoulder. “Fix the boat up—mend that
valve spring and have her ready for a dash some
time late to-night or early to-morrow morning!”</p>

<p>There was no delay at the place where the
auto had been left. Fortunately the gasoline and
oil tanks were filled, and explaining to the garage
keeper their need of haste the two chums were
off again.</p>

<p>On and on they rushed. The first part of the
auto trip was over good roads, and for this the
boys were thankful. It was about a hundred
miles to Brookville, where they hoped to find Dr.
Wright. They had about five hours of daylight
in which to make it and it would need an average
speed of twenty miles an hour to cover this.</p>

<p>“If we can reach Brookville by supper time,
and persuade Dr. Wright to come back with us,
we ought to get back to the boat some time in
the early morning,” Jerry calculated. “That will
give us a long day to make the trip back to camp.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if nothing happens,” Bob assented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing must happen!” cried Jerry fiercely.</p>

<p>And, for a time, all went well. Then, when
they had covered a bad bit of road, and reached
a smooth stretch, and when Jerry had put on
full speed, there came a sharp explosion.</p>

<p>“Back fire?” questioned Bob.</p>

<p>“Blow-out!” said Jerry, with a grim tightening
of his lips, as he felt the car skidding under
the stress of the collapsed tire.</p>

<p>Jerry brought the machine up with a jerk, and
was out on the ground almost before it had
stopped.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he cried grimly to his chum.
“Got to put on a new shoe.”</p>

<p>It was not easy work, and it seemed as though
it took them longer than usual, as it always does
when one is in a hurry. But, doubtless, they
worked with their usual speed.</p>

<p>Once more they were off again, and kept on
speeding. They halted at a country store to get
some crackers and a box of herring, also some
bottled soda water to relieve their thirst. They
ate on the run, glad enough to get their meal that
way.</p>

<p>Then a puncture delayed them, but working
with feverish haste, they managed to get in a new
tube. Then, tired, with aching muscles, and covered
with the oil from the motor boat, as well as
the dust of the road, they swung into Brookville,
and sent the car around a turn on two wheels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
into the hotel driveway.</p>

<p>Once more Jerry was out almost before the
vehicle had ceased rolling. Bob followed him
more slowly into the corridor of the hotel.</p>

<p>“Dr. Wright—is he here—yet?” panted
Jerry to the clerk.</p>

<p>That functionary looked up in surprise, and
not a little suspicion at the grimy and disheveled
figure before him.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Wright is here,” was the slow answer,
“but I don’t know that he will see you.
He is——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’ll see us,” said Jerry confidently.
“Don’t you remember us? We were here before.
This is Bob Baker, whom Dr. Wright
treated, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Of course! Now I know you. I
didn’t at first because you——”</p>

<p>“No apologies necessary,” interrupted Jerry.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright had evidently not forgotten the
motor boys, for he came down at once on receipt
of the message.</p>

<p>“Why, Jerry!” he exclaimed, and then he
drew back in surprise at the sight of his visitor.</p>

<p>Jerry plunged into the story of the professor’s
accident. He made it as clear as he could, but
it was rather an incoherent story, for all that.
Bob put in a word now and then.</p>

<p>“But do I understand you want me to travel
with you away up into the wilderness of the mountains—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a lonely hut, and there perform a delicate
operation on Professor Snodgrass?” asked
Dr. Wright, slowly.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Go with you in your automobile and motor
boat?”</p>

<p>“There’s no other way,” responded Jerry,
quietly. “No railroad will take us there any
quicker. And we must start at once. Here is
the note Dr. Brown told me to give you.”</p>

<p>The great surgeon stretched out his hand for
the paper. As he read it a different look came
over his face. It was as though he were a general
receiving news that he was about to take
part in some important engagement.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he murmured, “the DeVerne operation,”
for it was so named after its discoverer,
and Dr. Wright was a pupil of that famous
French surgeon. “Yes, that is the only hope in
a case like that. Dr. Brown was fortunate in
so quickly recognizing the necessity for it. Ah,
yes, indeed,” and Dr. Wright seemed lost in a
pleasant professional revery.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll come?” asked Jerry. “We
want to save his life, doctor—save the life of
Professor Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll come!” exclaimed the great surgeon.
“I have heard of your Professor Snodgrass.
I honor him as a true disciple of science.
I would do anything in my power to aid him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but,” and his voice grew more solemn, “I do
not promise to save his life.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders to express his doubt.
And then the spirit of the soldier—of the fighter—came
back to him. Indeed it had not deserted
him. He merely did not wish to raise false hopes.</p>

<p>“Come!” he cried. “We will go. I will get
ready at once. I will need—let me see——” and
he began to go over in his mind the things he
would need, as a general might before undertaking
a decisive engagement.</p>

<p>Unseen by the boys, Miss Payson, the nurse,
came down. She saw the doctor, and she must
have known what his attitude, and his words,
meant.</p>

<p>“Doctor! You’re not going out to-night—on
a case!” she exclaimed. “You forget you
came here for rest. You——”</p>

<p>“I forget nothing, my dear Miss Payson,” he
interrupted, with a smile. “I only know that I
am a doctor, and that a friend—a patient—needs
me. You will please get my case ready, and
prepare yourself. We are about to perform the
DeVerne operation.”</p>

<p>“The DeVerne operation!” she gasped.
“Here—now?”</p>

<p>“Not here and now. In a lonely cabin, away
up in the mountains. We shall have to travel
all night, by auto and part of to-morrow by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
boat. But it can be done—it shall be done!
These young men have come to call me to save
the life of Professor Snodgrass. So we will
go.</p>

<p>“You will please see that everything is ready.
Remember we shall need many things, so do not
omit any. Tell my sister. She will go with us.
You will need relief if you are to nurse this case.
Ah, the DeVerne operation!” and the doctor
rubbed his hands as though he welcomed the surgical
knot he must soon loosen.</p>

<p>“Very well, doctor,” answered Miss Payson.
Evidently she knew when she had sufficiently objected.</p>

<p>“I will be with you inside of an hour,” Dr.
Wright told Jerry. “Certain preparations must
be made. Meanwhile you had better rest and
refresh yourselves. Have you room to carry
three of us? My sister will go along as assistant
nurse to Miss Payson.”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of room,” replied Jerry,
quietly. “We will be ready for you in an hour.”</p>

<p>The preparations of the two youths were simple.
They washed in the hotel lavatory, and
ate—Bob especially doing the latter. Then, as
they had a night auto trip before them, they carefully
examined every part of the machine. The
tires were blown up afresh, a thorough oiling was
given to every part, and, in addition to the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
gasoline tank being filled, an extra five-gallon can
was taken along.</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute was Dr. Wright. He
had with him a bag of instruments, and other
things needful for the operation. Miss Payson
and Miss Wright were carrying valises containing
their personal belongings.</p>

<p>“We are ready, boys,” said the great surgeon,
calmly. “From now, until we reach the cabin,
we are in your hands.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll get you there,” promised Jerry.</p>

<p>None of those who participated in that night
ride ever forgot it. Shortly after starting from
the hotel in Brookville it began to rain, and the
storm increased in violence until at midnight it
was blowing a gale, and the rain was coming
down in torrents.</p>

<p>“Can we go on?” asked Dr. Wright, calmly,
from within the well-enclosed tonneau.</p>

<p>“The machine can,” said Jerry, wondering
what the doctor meant.</p>

<p>“And if the machine can, we can,” was the
reassuring reply.</p>

<p>The powerful lights marked out the muddy
and sloppy road that lay ahead of them. Fortunately
Jerry had been over it twice and he was
pretty familiar with it now. He drove on cautiously
enough, but at a pace that brought from
Miss Payson and Miss Wright exclamations of
alarm now and then. As for Dr. Wright, he betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
no fear whatever. He sat silent in one
corner of the big car.</p>

<p>“Will we be in time? Will we be in time?”
was the question that ran through Jerry’s mind
continually.</p>

<p>That every moment counted he well knew
from the look on the face of Dr. Wright as he
read the note Dr. Brown had written. Professor
Snodgrass was in imminent danger. That much
was certain. Could he be operated on in time?
Could he be given back the life that was so fast
slipping away, long enough to make the disclosure
he had hinted at in his delirium—a disclosure
that would prove the fraud of those who had
taken the land from Mrs. Hopkins? Jerry
asked himself those questions.</p>

<p>On and on they lurched in the auto. Now
they glided down some slippery hill, now they
climbed the opposite slope, with all power on.</p>

<p>It was raining hard when a faint streak of
light in the east showed that the dawn was trying
to break. It was still raining when they
headed for the shipyard.</p>

<p>“We had better stop and have some breakfast,”
suggested Dr. Wright, and when Jerry
looked a little dubious at the delay the surgeon
said: “We shall all be better for it, and able
to make better time. We must be in good shape
for what lies before us. We must neglect nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>They ate at a little restaurant near the dock.
Probably never before had the great Dr. Wright—the
New York specialist on whose nod millionaires
waited—dined in such a humble place. But
he made no comment, nor did his sister or the
nurse. It was a case of emergency, and they all
recognized it.</p>

<p>“Is she all right?” asked Jerry of the man at
the dock, as they went down, through the drizzling
rain, to where the <i>Scud</i> lay moored.</p>

<p>“Right as a trivet, sir!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called Jerry. “We’re on the
last lap, now!”</p>

<p>“And none too soon,” murmured Dr. Wright,
as he again read the note from Dr. Brown, giving
the nature of the injury and the symptoms of
Professor Snodgrass. “None too soon. Speed
her all you can, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“I will; yes, sir,” was the low answer.</p>

<p>The motor hummed and throbbed as the <i>Scud</i>
swung away from the pier and out into Silver
River.</p>

<p>Would they be in time?</p>

<p>Over and over again the chugging motor
seemed to say to Jerry:</p>

<p>“Will we be in time? Will we be in time?
In time—in time?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE OPERATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Part of the strain that had held all of them
under its spell seemed to be wearing off. They
were breathing more easily now.</p>

<p>True, the most critical part of what had been
undertaken was still before them—the operation.
Performed, as it must be, under the most unfavorable
circumstances, from a surgical standpoint,
there was every chance against Professor Snodgrass,
and very few in his favor.</p>

<p>“But we’re this far on the return trip,” said
Bob, with a sigh of relief, as they chugged forward
in the motor boat. “And that’s a whole
lot.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” agreed Miss Payson with a
smile. And Bob’s remark seemed to sum up the
whole situation. They were well on the way of
the return trip.</p>

<p>That, in itself, was a satisfaction, for there
was so much that might have happened—in fact,
so much that still might happen. But, on the
whole, travel by the river seemed more certain
than by road. Though the breaking down of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the motor on the initial trip did not seem to argue
much in that line.</p>

<p>But the night was over. They had the whole
day before them, and, with good luck, they would
reach the camp in the woods at night.</p>

<p>“Will you operate as soon as you arrive?”
asked Miss Payson of Dr. Wright.</p>

<p>“It all depends—on the patient. I fear I
shall have to. It has gone rather too long already,
since the accident. There is only a slight
chance—but, such as it is, we must take it.”</p>

<p>He had spoken in a low tone, though not so
low but that Jerry heard him. And the tall lad
felt a sense of foreboding; but not so much on his
own account. It was solely because he loved
the professor, and wanted to see him spared for
many years to come. For now Jerry was thoroughly
convinced that there had been some trickery,
and that the little scientist had not played
them false.</p>

<p>The motor was running true and “like a sewing
machine,” as Bob expressed it. He and Jerry
took turns at the wheel, in looking after the machinery,
and filling the oil cups. Dr. Wright sat
in the cabin, with his sister and Miss Payson,
talking in low tones about the coming operation,
and making what plans they could in advance.</p>

<p>On and on they raced—a race against the clock,
to save a life. Would they be in time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing they could do—that Bob or
Jerry could do—to increase the speed.</p>

<p>It was not like being in the auto. No advantage
could be taken of the better parts of the
road to make haste. All that could be done was
to keep the machinery going, see that it was oiled,
and steer a straight course. The extra five gallons
of gasoline which they had not needed for
the auto, were put aboard the <i>Scud</i>.</p>

<p>They had their dinner on the boat, and Bob
was in his element as cook. The ladies praised
his culinary skill, and that was enough to make
Bob happy.</p>

<p>They passed from the river to the lake, and
speeded on. Keen-eyed Jerry, at the wheel,
noted point after point, land-mark after land-mark,
as they passed them.</p>

<p>Bob and Jerry were standing on the raised
after-deck, near the wheel, talking, when Miss
Payson, who, with the doctor and his sister, was
in the cabin, came to the door, and asked:</p>

<p>“Is there anything wrong, boys? There is
some water on the floor in here. Perhaps something
has spilled.”</p>

<p>“Water?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry handed his chum the wheel, and went into
the cabin. He saw a little pool of water oozing
up from the cracks in the cabin floor.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s been holding us back!” he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
“I wondered what made her so heavy.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“A small leak,” Jerry replied. “Probably the
same seams that opened before are widening now.
We’ve been running pretty fast, and the vibration
of the motor has probably shaken out some
of the caulking.”</p>

<p>“Is there—is there any danger?” asked Miss
Wright.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Jerry assured her, though he was
not quite as sure as his voice indicated. “I’ll
start the pump.”</p>

<p>This soon brought the water down to a level
below the boards of the cabin floor, and for some
time no more came in. But the leak must have
grown, for, in spite of what the pump took out,
the floor was soon covered.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to bail,” said Jerry, grimly.
“But it won’t be more than three hours before
we’re at the end of the lake.”</p>

<p>They had indeed made good time, better even
than on the down trip, with the broken spring.
The motor had worked to perfection—too well,
in fact, for its vibrations had opened the seams.</p>

<p>“Bail!” cried Miss Payson.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have to dip out the water as fast
as it comes in,” said Jerry. “The pump hasn’t
capacity enough.”</p>

<p>The progress of the boat was slower now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
it was not until complete darkness had fallen that
they reached the improvised dock, whence the
trail led up to the cabin where the wounded professor
lay.</p>

<p>And the last mile was hardest of all, for the
boat was so water-logged that even the powerful
motor sent her along only at the pace of a scow.</p>

<p>“Well, she can’t sink, at any rate!” exclaimed
Jerry, as he fairly grounded her in shallow water
at the dock.</p>

<p>They made their way up the trail, carrying
with them all that was necessary for the operation.
But were they in time to perform it?</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” called the voice of Ned from
the cabin.</p>

<p>“We’re back, old man,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh!” and there was unmistakable relief in
Ned’s voice.</p>

<p>“How’s the professor?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Just about the same.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a chance,” murmured Dr.
Wright. “Now to get busy!”</p>

<p>Ned and Andy were quickly told of the race
to save a life—the race the final spurt of which
was now to be made. The boys who had been
at the cabin reported that nothing of moment
had transpired since Bob and Jerry departed.</p>

<p>Preparations for the operation were on apace.
I will not weary you with them, for such matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
are never very pleasant. Instruments were boiled,
to kill all germs. Bandages were laid in readiness.
The nurses donned their uniforms, and
the cabin was put in the best condition possible.</p>

<p>“You may come in and see him,” said Dr.
Wright to Jerry and his chums, about nine o’clock
that night. “We are about to start. He is conscious,
and wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“Will it be all right?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He is more nearly rational than
at any time since you brought him here.”</p>

<p>So they went in. The hapless professor was
swathed in a sheet on the table. He looked very
pale and thin in the light of candles and lamps,
but his eyes now had the look of consciousness.</p>

<p>“Jerry—Jerry,” he whispered in a faint voice.
“I—I can’t say much—I don’t know all that
happened—those scoundrels sent me up here to
get me out of the way—I know now. But I
have evidence against them. When I recover—tell
it all. That land is yours. I will give evidence——”</p>

<p>“That will do now,” said Dr. Wright gently,
and he motioned for the boys to go.</p>

<p>The sickly smell of ether filled the night air
about the cabin. The door was closed, as the
boys went down the trail. They did not want to
stay too near, and there was nothing they could
do. The operation had begun.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE TWO-TAILED LIZARD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Seconds seemed stretched into minutes, and
minutes into hours, as the boys waited. They
spoke little, not even when they went down to
look at the <i>Scud</i>. She was in shallow water, and
could easily be pulled up on shore, and the leaky
seams made tight.</p>

<p>“She lasted as long as we needed her,” remarked
Jerry, simply.</p>

<p>It must have been two hours later, perhaps
more, when Dr. Brown came out of the cabin.
His clothes smelled of ether and iodoform as he
greeted the boys, saying:</p>

<p>“It’s all over.”</p>

<p>“Is he—will he——?” faltered Jerry.</p>

<p>“He will recover, unless some complication
sets in,” was the answer. “The operation was a
complete success. Oh, it was worth watching, to
witness the masterly manner in which Dr. Wright
worked! I am under obligations to you boys for
giving me the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“It is we who are in your debt,” responded
Jerry. “Can we see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, indeed no. He has not come out of the
ether yet. I doubt if you can see him before
to-morrow noon. You had best go to bed. The
doctor and the nurses will look after him.”</p>

<p>And, worn out with their nights’ vigils—Jerry
and Bob from their long trips, and Ned and Andy
from watching—they all felt the need of rest and
sleep. But sleep came only fitfully at first, until,
toward morning, when they all fell into heavy
slumber.</p>

<p>They were awakened by Dr. Brown at their
tent.</p>

<p>They found the professor paler and thinner
than before, but looking better in spite of that,
for he was out of pain. The relief of the operation,
given under merciful insensibility of ether,
had delivered him from the grip of pain.</p>

<p>“I—I want to talk to you, Jerry,” he said,
faintly.</p>

<p>“Not too much,” cautioned Miss Payson.</p>

<p>“It—it will relieve my mind,” was the low
reply of the sick man. “I have something to
tell Jerry.”</p>

<p>They would not let him tell it all then, but he
said enough to let Jerry know that fraud had
been practiced by the Universal Plaster Company,
and that fraud, Jerry was sure, was sufficient
to set aside the sale, on the part of his
mother, of the valuable lands in the swamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few days Professor Snodgrass was able to
tell the whole story.</p>

<p>“I had no idea of the medical value of that
yellow clay until, on one of my trips after insects,
I met Fussel and Professor Bailey,” he said. “I
know now that they are scoundrels, but I had no
idea of it then. They asked me to test the yellow
clay for certain ingredients, and I did so. I
found them there, and they told me their plan—to
impregnate the clay with certain medicines. I
then saw how valuable a use of it could be made,
and I gave them a testimonial of its worth. They
paid me well. But if I had thought it was injuring
my friends I never would have aided those
scoundrels.</p>

<p>“I had no idea then, Jerry, that this was the
same clay you had showed me. For when I examined
your specimen I had no thought that it might
be a vehicle for the administration of medicine
in the shape of plasters and poultices.</p>

<p>“But from the moment I had given advice to
Fussel and his gang, I had no chance to communicate
with you. In fact, I did not know there
was a large deposit of this clay on your mother’s
land. They said it came from Mr. Nixon’s land,
and from another part of the swamp. So I was
not concerned about you, Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then they hurried me away, on the false assertion
that I could find a two-tailed lizard up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
here. I had no time even to come and see you.
In fact, I guess I did not think of it, I was so
excited.”</p>

<p>“We thought that strange,” commented Jerry,
“your not coming back.”</p>

<p>Jerry explained how he and his chums had set
off in search of the scientist, to get his explanation
of the matter, and Jerry told of their adventures
on the way.</p>

<p>“I intended to have another analysis made of
the clay, to see if it was of any value,” the tall
lad said, “but I did not get a chance. However,
it wasn’t necessary, Professor. But we sure did
think it queer that you didn’t come back to us.”</p>

<p>“It was odd,” the professor admitted. “But
I was so anxious to get the lizard that I thought
of nothing else. I came up here and made the
great discovery.”</p>

<p>“Did you find the lizard?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No. But one day, when I was out after
specimens, I opened one of the box-cages I had
brought with me from the hotel in Bellport,
where I was stopping when Fussel and his gang
sought my advice. In that box I found a certain
paper which showed me how I had been tricked.
It was one of the plaster company’s documents,
and must have fallen into my box by mistake. But
it gave away the whole plan, and showed how
they had played a trick to get your mother’s land,
Jerry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“A trick?” questioned the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Yes. They tried to make her believe she
would have no right of way to get to her strip,
and so, as I understand it, she sold.”</p>

<p>“That was one of the reasons that induced her
to part with it,” said Jerry. “That, and the fact
that we could not prove the yellow clay to be of
any value.”</p>

<p>“And that representation that she had no right
of way was a fraud,” the professor declared,
“for she had. And it is well established in law
that where the conveyance of land is obtained by
fraud that it will be given back to the original
owners.”</p>

<p>“Then mother will get her land back!” cried
Jerry, joyfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the valuable clay with it,” declared
Professor Snodgrass. “I will testify in her favor,
and I have the documents to prove it.”</p>

<p>“When did you discover them?” asked Ned,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“One day, as I say, when I was out hunting
specimens. I had just caught a rare bug, and
was putting it in the box, when the paper attracted
my attention. Then, as I took it out and
put the paper in my pocket, I saw a rare butterfly.
I made a reach for it with the net, and fell over
the ledge.</p>

<p>“I remembered nothing more for some time.
When I recovered consciousness I found myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
badly injured, at the foot of the cliff. My water
bottle and lunch box had fallen near me, and I
managed to eat and drink. But I could not move.
I called for help, but none came. Then I lost
consciousness again, and I remembered nothing
more until—until just before the operation.</p>

<p>“I understand you boys found me. You
saved my life!”</p>

<p>“And you have saved my mother’s property!”
voiced Jerry.</p>

<p>“You will find the papers to prove the fraud
in my coat,” the professor said, and there they
were. Jerry took charge of them.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t found the two-tailed lizard?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, and I am afraid I never shall,” was the
discouraged answer. “I don’t believe there are
any up here.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the camp was in a happy mood.
As the days passed the professor grew stronger.
There was no question now about his recovery.
Jerry had sent the good news to his mother, and
had communicated with the family lawyer, who
promised to see that action was taken against
the swindlers.</p>

<p>And I may state here that eventually Mrs.
Hopkins received back her land, and the sale of
the yellow clay recouped her fortune. In fact,
on the adjoining property there was only a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
amount of the clay, and Mrs. Hopkins had a
monopoly. So she did not have to worry about
money matters. Fraud was clearly proved on
the part of Fussel and his crowd, and though
they fought the case in the courts they were defeated.
The paper accidentally found in the professor’s
box won the case for Jerry and his
mother.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright, with his sister and the nurse, remained
at the camp until it was certain the professor
was out of danger. Then Dr. Brown was
placed in charge.</p>

<p>Jerry was a little apprehensive about Dr.
Wright’s bill, but that matter was easily settled.
When Jerry spoke of it the great surgeon laughed
and said:</p>

<p>“Do you think I would present Professor
Snodgrass with a bill for my services? We scientists
are brothers, you know. It was a pleasure
to preserve him for the great work he is doing.”</p>

<p>And so Dr. Wright, with the two ladies, went
back to civilization. The <i>Scud</i> had been hauled
out by the boys, the seams caulked, and she was
as fit as ever. In her the doctor was taken back
to his hotel.</p>

<p>The boys would remain in the woodland camp
about a week longer, and then, by easy stages,
would go back home, taking the scientist with
them as far as Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>One night Bob awoke with a yell, sitting suddenly
up in his bunk.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—got the nightmare?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but there’s something in my bed. A
snake, I guess,” Bob cried.</p>

<p>Ned came with a light, and Bob, hopping out
of his bed, turned back the sheet, for only that
light covering was needed on account of the warm
weather. As he did so something wriggled farther
under the covers.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Bob. “Look!”</p>

<p>“It’s something, anyhow,” Jerry agreed.</p>

<p>The coverings were thrown off and Bob cried:</p>

<p>“There it is! The two-tailed lizard!”</p>

<p>It was a large lizard, surely enough, and
Jerry, who had little fear of crawling creatures,
easily captured the specimen.</p>

<p>“I believe it <em>is</em> a two-tailed one,” he said. “At
least it might pass for one. Let’s show the professor.”</p>

<p>Dr. Snodgrass slowly examined the specimen
in the light of a lantern. He turned it carefully
from side to side.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you could call that a two-tailed
lizard,” he finally announced. “But it is
not what I expected. See, there is the rudiment
of the second tail,” and he pointed to a short
horny knob growing out above the main, or long
tail, of the wriggling creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nature evidently intended to give this species
of lizard two tails,” went on the professor, “but
something interfered with her plans. Perhaps
she, herself, changed her mind. But it is a sure-enough
two-tailed lizard, and will be a valuable
addition to our museum. And I can prove that
my friend Professor Battin is mistaken when he
says there is no such creature. Who found it?”</p>

<p>“It crawled in my bed,” spoke Bob, looking
around as though he might see more of the uncanny
creatures.</p>

<p>The professor was eagerly examining the specimen.
Undoubtedly it was the two-tailed lizard,
but it was not such an odd freak as might have
been expected. However, the scientist was apparently
satisfied. The lizard was put in a box,
and the next day the professor, who was rapidly
convalescing, made copious notes concerning it.</p>

<p>The motor boys spent another week in camp,
fishing and tramping about. The professor was
able to walk now. None of the plotters came
to drive our friends away from the hunting lodge.</p>

<p>And then, one day, camp was broken, and they
started down the lake, to finish the trip by auto,
Professor Snodgrass going with them.</p>

<p>“Well, we sure did have an exciting summer
of it,” commented Jerry, as he steered the boat
over the course on which he had guided her in
the race to save the life of the scientist.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “And I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
if we’ll have as lively a time next season?”</p>

<p>Whether our young friends did or did not may
be learned by reading our next volume, entitled:
“Ned, Bob and Jerry at Boxwood Hall; Or, The
Motor Boys as Freshmen.” This will be the first
volume of a second series devoted to the activities
of our heroes.</p>

<p>In due time the boys, with Professor Snodgrass,
reached Cresville. On the way the scientist
caught several more specimens, but none, in
his opinion, was as valuable as the two-tailed
lizard, which had made a bed-fellow of Bob.</p>

<p>“Where you going, Jerry?” asked Ned, one
afternoon, as he saw his chum starting out in the
motor boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, just over to the swamp to see how the
work is coming on. I heard they struck an even
richer bed of yellow clay on mother’s land than
that which those fellows developed at first.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come along,” went on Ned, and Bob
came up soon after, joining the little party.</p>

<p>And while they are on their way to watch the
men at work on the land so strangely restored
to Mrs. Hopkins, we will take leave of the
motor boys.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
